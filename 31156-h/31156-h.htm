when the pointer is moved over them, and words using diacritic characters in the
Latin Extended Additional block, which may not display in some fonts or browsers, will

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTELET<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> (from Med. Lat. <i>castella</i>), the word, sometimes
also written <i>castillet</i>, used in France for a building designed for the
defence of an outwork or gate, sometimes of great strength or
size, but distinguished from the <i>château</i>, or castle proper, in
being purely defensive and not residential. In Paris, before the
Revolution, this word was applied both to a particular building
and to the jurisdiction of which it was the seat. This building,
the original Châtelet, had been first a castle defending the approach
to the Cité. Tradition traced its existence back to Roman
times, and in the 18th century one of the rooms in the great
tower was still called the <i>chambre de César</i>. The jurisdiction was
that of the provostship (<i>prévôté</i>) and viscountship of Paris, which
was certainly of feudal origin, probably going back to the counts
of Paris.</p>

<p>It was not till the time of Saint Louis that, with the appointment
of Étienne Boileau, the provostship of Paris became a
<i>prévôté en garde</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a public office no longer put up to sale.
When the <i>baillis</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bailiff</a></span> AND <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bailie</a></span>) were created, the
provost of Paris naturally discharged the duties and functions
of a <i>bailli</i>, in which capacity he heard appeals from the seigniorial
and inferior judges of the city and its neighbourhood, keeping,
however, his title of provost. When under Henry II. certain
<i>bailliages</i> became presidial jurisdictions (<i>présidiaux</i>), <i>i.e.</i> received
to a certain extent the right of judging without appeal, the
Châtelet, the court of the provost of Paris, was made a presidial
court, but without losing its former name. Finally, various
tribunals peculiar to the city of Paris, <i>i.e.</i> courts exercising
jurisdictions outside the common law or corresponding to certain
<i>cours d&rsquo;exception</i> which existed in the provinces, were united with
the Châtelet, of which they became divisions (<i>chambres</i>). Thus
the lieutenant-general of police made it the seat of his jurisdiction,
and the provost of the Île de France, who had the same
criminal jurisdiction as the provosts of the marshals of France
in other provinces, sat there also. As to the <i>personnel</i> of the
Châtelet, it was originally the same as in the <i>bailliages</i>, except
that after the 14th century it had some special officials, the
auditors and the examiners of inquests. Like the <i>baillis</i>, the
provost had lieutenants who were deputies for him, and in
addition gradually acquired a considerable body of <i>ex officio</i>
councillors. This last staff, however, was not yet in existence at
the end of the 14th century, for it is not mentioned in the <i>Registre
criminel du Châtelet</i> (1389-1392), published by the Société des
Bibliophiles Français. In 1674 the whole <i>personnel</i> was doubled,
at the time when the new Châtelet was established side by side
with the old, the two being soon after amalgamated. On the eve
of the Revolution it comprised, beside the provost whose office
had become practically honorary, the <i>lieutenant civil</i>, who
presided over the <i>chambre de prévôté au parc civil</i> or court of first
instance; the <i>lieutenant criminel</i>, who presided over the criminal
court; two <i>lieutenants particuliers</i>, who presided in turn over
the <i>chambre du présidial</i> or court of appeal from the inferior
jurisdictions; a <i>juge auditeur</i>; sixty-four councillors (<i>conseillers</i>);
the <i>procureur du roi</i>, four <i>avocats du roi</i>, and eight
<i>substituts</i>, <i>i.e.</i> deputies of the <i>procureur</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Procurator</a></span>), beside
a host of minor officials. The history of the Châtelet under the
Revolution may be briefly told: the Constituent Assembly empowered
it to try cases of <i>lèse-nation</i>, and it was also before this
court that was opened the inquiry following on the events of
the 5th and 6th of August 1789. It was suppressed by the law
of the 16th of August 1790, together with the other tribunals of
the <i>ancien régime</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTELLERAULT<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span>, a town of western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Vienne, 19 m. N.N.E.
of Poitiers on the Orleans railway between that town and
Tours. Pop. (1906) 15,214. Châtellerault is situated on the
right and eastern bank of the Vienne; it is connected with the
suburb of Châteauneuf on the opposite side of the river by a
stone bridge of the 16th and 17th centuries, guarded at the
western extremity by massive towers. The manufacture of
cutlery is carried on on a large scale in villages on the banks of
the Clain, south of the town. Of the other industrial establishments
the most important is the national small-arms factory,
which was established in 1815 in Châteauneuf, and employs
from 1500 to 5500 men. Châtellerault (or Châtelherault:
<i>Castellum Airaldi</i>) derives its name from a fortress built in
the 10th century by Airaud, viscount of its territory. In 1515
it was made a duchy in favour of François de Bourbon, but it
was not long after this date that it became reunited to the
crown. In 1548 it was bestowed on James Hamilton, 2nd earl
of Arran (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hamilton</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATHAM, WILLIAM PITT<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span>, 1st <span class="sc">Earl of</span> (1708-1778), English
statesman, was born at Westminster on the 15th of November
1708. He was the younger son of Robert Pitt of Boconnoc,
Cornwall, and grandson of Thomas Pitt (1653-1726), governor
of Madras, who was known as &ldquo;Diamond&rdquo; Pitt, from the fact
of his having sold a diamond of extraordinary size to the regent
Orleans for something like £135,000. It was mainly by this
fortunate transaction that the governor was enabled to raise
his family, which was one of old standing, to a position of wealth
and political influence. The latter he acquired by purchasing
the burgage tenures of Old Sarum.</p>

<p>William Pitt was educated at Eton, and in January 1727 was
entered as a gentleman commoner at Trinity College, Oxford.
There is evidence that he was an extensively read, if not a
minutely accurate classical scholar; and it is interesting to
know that Demosthenes was his favourite author, and that he
diligently cultivated the faculty of expression by the practice of
translation and re-translation. An hereditary gout, from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span>
he had suffered even during his school-days, compelled him to
leave the university without taking his degree, in order to travel
abroad. He spent some time in France and Italy; but the
disease proved intractable, and he continued subject to attacks
of growing intensity at frequent intervals till the close of his life.
In 1727 his father had died, and on his return home it was
necessary for him, as the younger son, to choose a profession.
Having chosen the army, he obtained through the interest of his
friends a cornet&rsquo;s commission in the dragoons. But his military
career was destined to be short. His elder brother Thomas
having been returned at the general election of 1734 both for
Oakhampton and for Old Sarum, and having preferred to sit for
the former, the family borough fell to the younger brother by the
sort of natural right usually recognized in such cases. Accordingly,
in February 1735, William Pitt entered parliament as
member for Old Sarum. Attaching himself at once to the formidable
band of discontented Whigs known as the Patriots, whom
Walpole&rsquo;s love of exclusive power had forced into opposition
under Pulteney, he became in a very short time one of its most
prominent members. His maiden speech was delivered in April
1736, in the debate on the congratulatory address to the king on
the marriage of the prince of Wales. The occasion was one of
compliment, and there is nothing striking in the speech as reported;
but it served to gain for him the attention of the house
when he presented himself, as he soon afterwards did, in debates
of a party character. So obnoxious did he become as a critic of
the government, that Walpole thought fit to punish him by
procuring his dismissal from the army. Some years later he had
occasion vigorously to denounce the system of cashiering officers
for political differences, but with characteristic loftiness of spirit
he disdained to make any reference to his own case. The loss
of his commission was soon made up to him. The heir to the
throne, as was usually the case in the house of Hanover, if not
in reigning families generally, was the patron of the opposition,
and the ex-cornet became groom of the bed-chamber to the
prince of Wales. In this new position his hostility to the government
did not, as may be supposed, in any degree relax. He had
all the natural gifts an orator could desire&mdash;a commanding presence,
a graceful though somewhat theatrical bearing, an eye of
piercing brightness, and a voice of the utmost flexibility. His
style, if occasionally somewhat turgid, was elevated and passionate,
and it always bore the impress of that intensity of conviction
which is the most powerful instrument a speaker can have to sway
the convictions of an audience. It was natural, therefore, that
in the series of stormy debates, protracted through several years,
that ended in the downfall of Walpole, his eloquence should have
been one of the strongest of the forces that combined to bring
about the final result. Specially effective, according to contemporary
testimony, were his speeches against the Hanoverian
subsidies, against the Spanish convention in 1739, and in favour
of the motion in 1742 for an investigation into the last ten years
of Walpole&rsquo;s administration. It must be borne in mind that the
reports of these speeches which have come down to us were made
from hearsay, or at best from recollection, and are necessarily
therefore most imperfect. The best-known specimen of Pitt&rsquo;s
eloquence, his reply to the sneers of Horatio Walpole at his youth
and declamatory manner, which has found a place in so many handbooks
of elocution, is evidently, in form at least, the work, not of
Pitt, but of Dr Johnson, who furnished the report to the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>. Probably Pitt did say something of the kind
attributed to him, though even this is by no means certain in view
of Johnson&rsquo;s repentant admission that he had often invented not
merely the form, but the substance of entire debates.</p>

<p>In 1742 Walpole was at last forced to succumb to the long-continued
attacks of opposition, and was succeeded as prime
minister by the earl of Wilmington, though the real power in
the new government was divided between Carteret and the
Pelhams. Pitt&rsquo;s conduct on the change of administration was
open to grave censure. The relentless vindictiveness with
which he insisted on the prosecution of Walpole, and supported
the bill of indemnity to witnesses against the fallen minister,
was in itself not magnanimous; but it appears positively unworthy
when it is known that a short time before Pitt had offered,
on certain conditions, to use all his influence in the other direction.
Possibly he was embittered at the time by the fact that, owing
to the strong personal dislike of the king, caused chiefly by the
contemptuous tone in which he had spoken of Hanover, he did
not by obtaining a place in the new ministry reap the fruits of
the victory to which he had so largely contributed. The so-called
&ldquo;broad-bottom&rdquo; administration formed by the Pelhams in
1744, after the dismissal of Carteret, though it included several
of those with whom he had been accustomed to act, did not at
first include Pitt himself even in a subordinate office. Before
the obstacle to his admission was overcome, he had received a
remarkable accession to his private fortune. The eccentric
duchess of Marlborough, dying in 1744, at the age of ninety,
left him a legacy of £10,000 as an &ldquo;acknowledgment of the
noble defence he had made for the support of the laws of England
and to prevent the ruin of his country.&rdquo; As her hatred was
known to be at least as strong as her love, the legacy was probably
as much a mark of her detestation of Walpole as of her admiration
of Pitt. It may be mentioned here, though it does not come in
chronological order, that Pitt was a second time the object of a
form of acknowledgment of public virtue which few statesmen
have had the fortune to receive even once. About twenty years
after the Marlborough legacy, Sir William Pynsent, a Somersetshire
baronet to whom he was personally quite unknown, left
him his entire estate, worth about three thousand a year, in
testimony of approval of his political career.</p>

<p>It was with no very good grace that the king at length consented
to give Pitt a place in the government, although the latter did
all he could to ingratiate himself at court, by changing his tone
on the questions on which he had made himself offensive. To
force the matter, the Pelhams had to resign expressly on the
question whether he should be admitted or not, and it was only
after all other arrangements had proved impracticable, that they
were reinstated with the obnoxious politician as vice-treasurer
of Ireland. This was in February 1746. In May of the same
year he was promoted to the more important and lucrative office
of paymaster-general, which gave him a place in the privy council,
though not in the cabinet. Here he had an opportunity of displaying
his public spirit and integrity in a way that deeply impressed
both the king and the country. It had been the usual practice
of previous paymasters to appropriate to themselves the interest
of all money lying in their hands by way of advance, and also to
accept a commission of &frac12;% on all foreign subsidies. Although
there was no strong public sentiment against the practice, Pitt
altogether refused to profit by it. All advances were lodged by
him in the Bank of England until required, and all subsidies
were paid over without deduction, even though it was pressed
upon him, so that he did not draw a shilling from his office
beyond the salary legally attaching to it. Conduct like this,
though obviously disinterested, did not go without immediate
and ample reward, in the public confidence which it created,
and which formed the mainspring of Pitt&rsquo;s power as a statesman.</p>

<p>The administration formed in 1746 lasted without material
change till 1754. It would appear from his published correspondence
that Pitt had a greater influence in shaping its policy
than his comparatively subordinate position would in itself have
entitled him to. His conduct in supporting measures, such as
the Spanish treaty and the continental subsidies, which he
had violently denounced when in opposition, had been much
criticized; but within certain limits, not indeed very well
defined, inconsistency has never been counted a vice in an English
statesman. The times change, and he is not blamed for changing
with the times. Pitt in office, looking back on the commencement
of his public life, might have used the plea &ldquo;A good deal has
happened since then,&rdquo; at least as justly as some others have
done. Allowance must always be made for the restraints and
responsibilities of office. In Pitt&rsquo;s case, too, it is to be borne in
mind that the opposition with which he had acted gradually
dwindled away, and that it ceased to have any organized existence
after the death of the prince of Wales in 1751. Then in regard
to the important question with Spain as to the right of search,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
Pitt has disarmed criticism by acknowledging that the course
he followed during Wapole&rsquo;s administration was indefensible.
All due weight being given to these various considerations, it
must be admitted, nevertheless, that Pitt did overstep the
limits within which inconsistency is usually regarded as venial.
His one great object was first to gain office, and then to make
his tenure of office secure by conciliating the favour of the king.
The entire revolution which much of his policy underwent in
order to effect this object bears too close a resemblance to the
sudden and inexplicable changes of front habitual to placemen
of the Tadpole stamp to be altogether pleasant to contemplate
in a politician of pure aims and lofty ambition. Humiliating
is not too strong a term to apply to a letter in which he expresses
his desire to &ldquo;efface the past by every action of his life,&rdquo; in order
that he may stand well with the king.</p>

<p>In 1754 Henry Pelham died, and was succeeded at the head of
affairs by his brother, the duke of Newcastle. To Pitt the change
brought no advancement, and he had thus an opportunity of
testing the truth of the description of his chief given by Sir
Robert Walpole, &ldquo;His name is treason.&rdquo; But there was for a
time no open breach. Pitt continued at his post; and at the
general election which took place during the year he even
accepted a nomination for the duke&rsquo;s pocket borough of Aldborough.
He had sat for Seaford since 1747. When parliament
met, however, he was not long in showing the state of his feelings.
Ignoring Sir Thomas Robinson, the political nobody to whom
Newcastle had entrusted the management of the Commons,
he made frequent and vehement attacks on Newcastle himself,
though still continuing to serve under him. In this strange
state matters continued for about a year. At length, just after
the meeting of parliament in November 1751, Pitt was dismissed
from office, having on the debate on the address spoken at great
length against a new system of continental subsidies, proposed by
the government of which he was a member. Fox, who had
just before been appointed secretary of state, retained his place,
and though the two men continued to be of the same party, and
afterwards served again in the same government, there was
henceforward a rivalry between them, which makes the celebrated
opposition of their illustrious sons seem like an inherited quarrel.</p>

<p>Another year had scarcely passed when Pitt was again in
power. The inherent weakness of the government, the vigour
and eloquence of his opposition, and a series of military disasters
abroad combined to rouse a public feeling of indignation which
could not be withstood, and in December 1756 Pitt, who now
sat for Okehampton, became secretary of state, and leader of
the Commons under the premiership of the duke of Devonshire.
He had made it a condition of his joining any administration
that Newcastle should be excluded from it, thus showing a
resentment which, though natural enough, proved fatal to the
lengthened existence of his government. With the king unfriendly,
and Newcastle, whose corrupt influence was still
dominant in the Commons, estranged, it was impossible to
carry on a government by the aid of public opinion alone, however
emphatically that might have declared itself on his side.
In April 1757, accordingly, he found himself again dismissed
from office on account of his opposition to the king&rsquo;s favourite
continental policy. But the power that was insufficient to keep
him in office was strong enough to make any arrangement that
excluded him impracticable. The public voice spoke in a way
that was not to be mistaken. Probably no English minister
ever received in so short a time so many proofs of the confidence
and admiration of the public, the capital and all the chief towns
voting him addresses and the freedom of their corporations.
From the political deadlock that ensued relief could only be had
by an arrangement between Newcastle and Pitt. After some
weeks&rsquo; negotiation, in the course of which the firmness and
moderation of &ldquo;the Great Commoner,&rdquo; as he had come to be
called, contrasted favourably with the characteristic tortuosities
of the crafty peer, matters were settled on such a basis that,
while Newcastle was the nominal, Pitt was the virtual head of
the government. On his acceptance of office he was chosen
member for Bath.</p>

<p>This celebrated administration was formed in June 1757, and
continued in power till 1761. During the four years of its
existence it has been usual to say that the biography of Pitt is
the history of England, so thoroughly was he identified with the
great events which make this period, in so far as the external
relations of the country are concerned, one of the most glorious
in her annals. A detailed account of these events belongs to
history; all that is needed in a biography is to point out the
extent to which Pitt&rsquo;s personal influence may really be traced
in them. It is scarcely too much to say that, in the general
opinion of his contemporaries, the whole glory of these years
was due to his single genius; his alone was the mind that planned,
and his the spirit that animated the brilliant achievements of
the British arms in all the four quarters of the globe. Posterity,
indeed, has been able to recognize more fully the independent
genius of those who carried out his purposes. The heroism of
Wolfe would have been irrepressible, Clive would have proved
himself &ldquo;a heaven-born general,&rdquo; and Frederick the Great
would have written his name in history as one of the most skilful
strategists the world has known, whoever had held the seals of
office in England. But Pitt&rsquo;s relation to all three was such as to
entitle him to a large share in the credit of their deeds. It was
his discernment that selected Wolfe to lead the attack on Quebec,
and gave him the opportunity of dying a victor on the heights of
Abraham. He had personally less to do with the successes in
India than with the other great enterprises that shed an undying
lustre on his administration; but his generous praise in parliament
stimulated the genius of Clive, and the forces that acted
at the close of the struggle were animated by his indomitable
spirit. Pitt, the first real Imperialist in modern English history,
was the directing mind in the expansion of his country, and
with him the beginning of empire is rightly associated. The
Seven Years&rsquo; War might well, moreover, have been another
Thirty Years&rsquo; War if Pitt had not furnished Frederick with
an annual subsidy of £700,000, and in addition relieved him of
the task of defending western Germany against France.</p>

<p>Contemporary opinion was, of course, incompetent to estimate
the permanent results gained for the country by the brilliant
foreign policy of Pitt. It has long been generally agreed that
by several of his most costly expeditions nothing was really won
but glory. It has even been said that the only permanent
acquisition that England owed directly to him was her Canadian
dominion; and, strictly speaking, this is true, it being admitted
that the campaign by which the Indian empire was virtually won
was not planned by him, though brought to a successful issue
during his ministry. But material aggrandizement, though
the only tangible, is not the only real or lasting effect of a war
policy. More may be gained by crushing a formidable rival than
by conquering a province. The loss of her Canadian possessions
was only one of a series of disasters suffered by France, which
radically affected the future of Europe and the world. Deprived
of her most valuable colonies both in the East and in the West,
and thoroughly defeated on the continent, her humiliation was
the beginning of a new epoch in history. The victorious policy
of Pitt destroyed the military prestige which repeated experience
has shown to be in France as in no other country the very life
of monarchy, and thus was not the least considerable of the many
influences that slowly brought about the French Revolution.
It effectually deprived her of the lead in the councils of Europe
which she had hitherto arrogated to herself, and so affected the
whole course of continental politics. It is such far-reaching
results as these, and not the mere acquisition of a single colony,
however valuable, that constitute Pitt&rsquo;s claim to be considered
as on the whole the most powerful minister that ever guided the
foreign policy of England.</p>

<p>The first and most important of a series of changes which
ultimately led to the dissolution of the ministry was the death
of George II. on the 25th of October 1760, and the accession of
his grandson, George III. The new king had, as was natural, new
counsellors of his own, the chief of whom, Lord Bute, was at once
admitted to the cabinet as a secretary of state. Between Bute
and Pitt there speedily arose an occasion of serious difference.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
The existence of the so-called family compact by which the
Bourbons of France and Spain bound themselves in an offensive
alliance against England having been brought to light, Pitt urged
that it should be met by an immediate declaration of war with
Spain. To this course Bute would not consent, and as his refusal
was endorsed by all his colleagues save Temple, Pitt had no
choice but to leave a cabinet in which his advice on a vital
question had been rejected. On his resignation, which took
place in October 1761, the king urged him to accept some signal
mark of royal favour in the form most agreeable to himself.
Accordingly he obtained a pension of £3000 a year for three lives,
and his wife, Lady Hester Grenville, whom he had married in
1754, was created Baroness Chatham in her own right. In connexion
with the latter gracefully bestowed honour it may be
mentioned that Pitt&rsquo;s domestic life was a singularly happy one.</p>

<p>Pitt&rsquo;s spirit was too lofty to admit of his entering on any
merely factious opposition to the government he had quitted.
On the contrary, his conduct after his retirement was distinguished
by a moderation and disinterestedness which, as
Burke has remarked, &ldquo;set a seal upon his character.&rdquo; The war
with Spain, in which he had urged the cabinet to take the initiative,
proved inevitable; but he scorned to use the occasion
for &ldquo;altercation and recrimination,&rdquo; and spoke in support of
the government measures for carrying on the war. To the
preliminaries of the peace concluded in February 1763 he offered
an indignant resistance, considering the terms quite inadequate
to the successes that had been gained by the country. When the
treaty was discussed in parliament in December of the preceding
year, though suffering from a severe attack of gout, he was carried
down to the House, and in a speech of three hours&rsquo; duration,
interrupted more than once by paroxysms of pain, he strongly
protested against its various conditions. The physical cause
which rendered this effort so painful probably accounts for the
infrequency of his appearances in parliament, as well as for much
that is otherwise inexplicable in his subsequent conduct. In
1763 he spoke against the obnoxious tax on cider, imposed by
his brother-in-law, George Grenville, and his opposition, though
unsuccessful in the House, helped to keep alive his popularity
with the country, which cordially hated the excise and all connected
with it. When next year the question of general warrants
was raised in connexion with the case of Wilkes, Pitt vigorously
maintained their illegality, thus defending at once the privileges
of Parliament and the freedom of the press. During 1765 he
seems to have been totally incapacitated for public business.
In the following year he supported with great power the proposal
of the Rockingham administration for the repeal of the
American Stamp Act, arguing that it was unconstitutional to
impose taxes upon the colonies. He thus endorsed the contention
of the colonists on the ground of principle, while the majority of
those who acted with him contented themselves with resisting the
disastrous taxation scheme on the ground of expediency. The
Repeal Act, indeed, was only passed <i>pari passu</i> with another
censuring the American assemblies, and declaring the authority
of the British parliament over the colonies &ldquo;in all cases whatsoever&rdquo;;
so that the House of Commons repudiated in the most
formal manner the principle Pitt laid down. His language in
approval of the resistance of the colonists was unusually bold,
and perhaps no one but himself could have employed it with
impunity at a time when the freedom of debate was only imperfectly
conceded.</p>

<p>Pitt had not been long out of office when he was solicited to
return to it, and the solicitations were more than once renewed.
Unsuccessful overtures were made to him in 1763, and twice
in 1765, in May and June&mdash;the negotiator in May being the
king&rsquo;s uncle, the duke of Cumberland, who went down in person
to Hayes, Pitt&rsquo;s seat in Kent. It is known that he had the
opportunity of joining the marquis of Rockingham&rsquo;s short-lived
administration at any time on his own terms, and his conduct
in declining an arrangement with that minister has been more
generally condemned than any other step in his public life. In
July 1766 Rockingham was dismissed, and Pitt was entrusted by
the king with the task of forming a government entirely on his
own conditions. The result was a cabinet, strong much beyond
the average in its individual members, but weak to powerlessness
in the diversity of its composition. Burke, in a memorable
passage of a memorable speech, has described this &ldquo;chequered
and speckled&rdquo; administration with great humour, speaking of
it as &ldquo;indeed a very curious show, but utterly unsafe to touch
and unsure to stand on.&rdquo; Pitt chose for himself the office of
lord privy seal, which necessitated his removal to the House of
Lords; and in August he became earl of Chatham and Viscount
Pitt.</p>

<p>By the acceptance of a peerage the great commoner lost at
least as much and as suddenly in popularity as he gained in
dignity. One significant indication of this may be mentioned.
In view of his probable accession to power, preparations were
made in the city of London for a banquet and a general illumination
to celebrate the event. But the celebration was at once
countermanded when it was known that he had become earl of
Chatham. The instantaneous revulsion of public feeling was
somewhat unreasonable, for Pitt&rsquo;s health seems now to have
been beyond doubt so shattered by his hereditary malady, that
he was already in old age though only fifty-eight. It was natural,
therefore, that he should choose a sinecure office, and the ease of
the Lords. But a popular idol nearly always suffers by removal
from immediate contact with the popular sympathy, be the
motives for removal what they may.</p>

<p>One of the earliest acts of the new ministry was to lay an
embargo upon corn, which was thought necessary in order to
prevent a dearth resulting from the unprecedentedly bad
harvest of 1766. The measure was strongly opposed, and Lord
Chatham delivered his first speech in the House of Lords in
support of it. It proved to be almost the only measure introduced
by his government in which he personally interested himself.
His attention had been directed to the growing importance of
the affairs of India, and there is evidence in his correspondence
that he was meditating a comprehensive scheme for transferring
much of the power of the company to the crown, when he was
withdrawn from public business in a manner that has always
been regarded as somewhat mysterious. It may be questioned,
indeed, whether even had his powers been unimpaired he could
have carried out any decided policy on any question with a
cabinet representing interests so various and conflicting; but,
as it happened, he was incapacitated physically and mentally
during nearly the Whole period of his tenure of office. He
scarcely ever saw any of his colleagues though they repeatedly
and urgently pressed for interviews with him, and even an offer
from the king to visit him in person was declined, though in the
language of profound and almost abject respect which always
marked his communications with the court. It has been insinuated
both by contemporary and by later critics that being
disappointed at his loss of popularity, and convinced of the
impossibility of co-operating with his colleagues, he exaggerated
his malady as a pretext for the inaction that was forced upon
him by circumstances. But there is no sufficient reason to doubt
that he was really, as his friends represented, in a state that
utterly unfitted him for business. He seems to have been freed
for a time from the pangs of gout only to be afflicted with a
species of mental alienation bordering on insanity. This is the
most satisfactory, as it is the most obvious, explanation of
his utter indifference in presence of one of the most momentous
problems that ever pressed for solution on an English statesman.
Those who are able to read the history in the light of what
occurred later may perhaps be convinced that no policy whatever
initiated, after 1766 could have prevented or even materially
delayed the declaration of American independence; but to the
politicians of that time the coming event had not yet cast so
dark a shadow before as to paralyse all action, and if any man
could have allayed the growing discontent of the colonists and
prevented the ultimate dismemberment of the empire, it would
have been Lord Chatham. The fact that he not only did nothing
to remove existing difficulties, but remained passive while his
colleagues took the fatal step which led directly to separation,
is in itself clear proof of his entire incapacity. The imposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
of the import duty on tea and other commodities was the project
of Charles Townshend, and was carried into effect in 1767 without
consultation with Lord Chatham, if not in opposition to his
wishes. It is probably the most singular thing in connexion
with this singular administration, that its most pregnant measure
should thus have been one directly opposed to the well-known
principles of its head.</p>

<p>For many months things remained in the curious position that
he who was understood to be the head of the cabinet had as little
share in the government of the country as an unenfranchised
peasant. As the chief could not or would not lead, the subordinates
naturally chose their own paths and not his. The
lines of Chatham&rsquo;s policy were abandoned in other cases besides
the imposition of the import duty; his opponents were taken
into confidence; and friends, such&rsquo; as Amherst and Shelburne,
were dismissed from their posts. When at length in October
1768 he tendered his resignation on the ground of shattered
health, he did not fail to mention the dismissal of Amherst and
Shelburne as a personal grievance.</p>

<p>Soon after his resignation a renewed attack of gout freed
Chatham from the mental disease under which he had so long
suffered. He had been nearly two years and a half in seclusion
when, in July 1769, he again appeared in public at a royal levee.
It was not, however, until 1770 that he resumed his seat in the
House of Lords. He had now almost no personal following,
mainly owing to the grave mistake he had made in not forming
an alliance with the Rockingham party. But his eloquence was
as powerful as ever, and all its power was directed against the
government policy in the contest with America, which had
become the question of all-absorbing interest. His last appearance
in the House of Lords was on the 7th of April 1778, on the
occasion of the duke of Richmond&rsquo;s motion for an address
praying the king to conclude peace with America on any terms.
In view of the hostile demonstrations of France the various
parties had come generally to see the necessity of such a measure.
But Chatham could not brook the thought of a step which
implied submission to the &ldquo;natural enemy&rdquo; whom it had been
the main object of his life to humble, and he declaimed for a
considerable time, though with sadly diminished vigour, against
the motion. After the duke of Richmond had replied, he rose
again excitedly as if to speak, pressed his hand upon his breast,
and fell down in a fit. He was removed to his seat at Hayes,
where he died on the 11th of May. With graceful unanimity
all parties combined to show their sense of the national loss.
The Commons presented an address to the king praying that the
deceased statesman might be buried with the honours of a public
funeral, and voted a sum for a public monument which was
erected over his grave in Westminster Abbey. Soon after the
funeral a bill was passed bestowing a pension of £4000 a year
on his successors in the earldom. He had a family of three
sons and two daughters, of whom the second son, William,
was destined to add fresh lustre to a name which is one of the
greatest in the history of England.</p>

<p>Dr Johnson is reported to have said that &ldquo;Walpole was a
minister given by the king to the people, but Pitt was a minister
given by the people to the king,&rdquo; and the remark correctly
indicates Chatham&rsquo;s distinctive place among English statesmen.
He was the first minister whose main strength lay in the support
of the nation at large as distinct from its representatives in the
Commons, where his personal following was always small. He
was the first to discern that public opinion, though generally
slow to form and slow to act, is in the end the paramount power
in the state; and he was the first to use it not in an emergency
merely, but throughout a whole political career. He marks the
commencement of that vast change in the movement of English
politics by which it has come about that the sentiment of the
great mass of the people now tells effectively on the action of
the government from day to day,&mdash;almost from hour to hour.
He was well fitted to secure the sympathy and admiration of his
countrymen, for his virtues and his failings were alike English.
He was often inconsistent, he was generally intractable and
overbearing, and he was always pompous and affected to a
degree which, Macaulay has remarked, seems scarcely compatible
with true greatness. Of the last quality evidence is furnished
in the stilted style of his letters, and in the fact recorded by
Seward that he never permitted his under-secretaries to sit in
his presence. Burke speaks of &ldquo;some significant, pompous,
creeping, explanatory, ambiguous matter, in the true Chathamic
style.&rdquo; But these defects were known only to the inner circle
of his associates. To the outside public he was endeared as a
statesman who could do or suffer &ldquo;nothing base,&rdquo; and who had
the rare power of transfusing his own indomitable energy and
courage into all who served under him. &ldquo;A spirited foreign
policy&rdquo; has always been popular in England, and Pitt was the
most popular of English ministers, because he was the most
successful exponent of such a policy. In domestic affairs his
influence was small and almost entirely indirect. He himself
confessed his unfitness for dealing with questions of finance. The
commercial prosperity that was produced by his war policy was
in a great part delusive, as prosperity so produced must always
be, though it had permanent effects of the highest moment in the
rise of such centres of industry as Glasgow. This, however, was
a remote result which he could have neither intended nor foreseen.</p>

<p>The correspondence of Lord Chatham, in four volumes, was
published in 1838-1840; and a volume of his letters to Lord Camelford
in 1804. The Rev. Francis Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>History of the Rt. Hon.
William Pitt, Earl of Chatham</i> (2 vols., 1827), is a ponderous and
shapeless work. Frederic Harrison&rsquo;s <i>Chatham</i>, in the &ldquo;Twelve
English Statesmen&rdquo; series (1905), though skilfully executed, takes a
rather academic and modern Liberal view. A German work, <i>William
Pitt, Graf von Chatham</i>, by Albert von Ruville (3 vols., 1905; English
trans. 1907), is the best and most thorough account of Chatham,
his period, and his policy, which has appeared. See also the separate

on the Miramichi river, 24 m. from its mouth and 10 m. by rail
from Chatham junction on the Intercolonial railway. Pop. (1901)
5000. The town contains the Roman Catholic pro-cathedral,
many large saw-mills, pulp-mills, and several establishments
for curing and exporting fish. The lumber trade, the fisheries,
and the manufacture of pulp are the chief industries.</p>

Trunk, Canadian Pacific and Lake Erie &amp; Detroit River railways.
Pop. (1901) 9068. It has steamboat connexion with Detroit and
the cities on Lakes Huron and Erie. It is situated in a rich agricultural
and fruit-growing district, and carries on a large export
trade. It contains a large wagon factory, planing and flour mills,
manufactories of fanning mills, binder-twine, woven wire goods,
engines, windmills, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATHAM<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span>, a port and municipal and parliamentary borough
of Kent, England, on the right bank of the Medway, 34 m.
E.S.E. of London by the South-Eastern &amp; Chatham railway.
Pop. (1891) 31,657; (1901) 37,057. Though a distinct borough
it is united on the west with Rochester and on the east with
Gillingham, so that the three boroughs form, in appearance, a
single town with a population which in 1901 exceeded 110,000.
With the exception of the dockyards and fortifications there are
few objects of interest. St Mary&rsquo;s church was opened in 1903, but
occupies a site which bore a church in Saxon times, though the
previous building dated only from 1786. A brass commemorates
Stephen Borough (d. 1584), discoverer of the northern passage
to Archangel in Russia (1553). St Bartholomew&rsquo;s chapel,
originally attached to the hospital for lepers (one of the first in
England), founded by Gundulph, bishop of Rochester, in 1070,
is in part Norman. The funds for the maintenance of the hospital
were appropriated by decision of the court of chancery to the
hospital of St Bartholomew erected in 1863 within the boundaries
of Rochester. The almshouse established in 1592 by Sir John
Hawkins for decayed seamen and shipwrights is still extant, the
building having been re-erected in the 19th century; but the fund
called the Chatham Chest, originated by Hawkins and Drake in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
1588, was incorporated with Greenwich Hospital in 1802. In
front of the Royal Engineers&rsquo; Institute is a statue (1890) of
General Gordon, and near the railway station another (1888) to
Thomas Waghorn, promoter of the overland route to India. In
1905 King Edward VII. unveiled a fine memorial arch commemorating
Royal Engineers who fell in the South African War.
It stands in the parade ground of the Brompton barracks, facing
the Crimean arch. There are numerous brickyards, lime-kilns
and flour-mills in the district neighbouring to Chatham; and the
town carries on a large retail trade, in great measure owing to
the presence of the garrison. The fortifications are among the
most elaborate in the kingdom. The so-called Chatham Lines
enclose New Brompton, a part of the borough of Gillingham.
They were begun in 1758 and completed in 1807, but have been
completely modernized. They are strengthened by several
detached forts and redoubts. Fort Pitt, which rises above the
town to the west, was built in 1779, and is used as a general
military hospital. It was regarded as the principal establishment
of the kind in the country till the foundation of Netley in Hampshire.
The lines include the Chatham, the Royal Marine, the
Brompton, the Hut, St Mary&rsquo;s and naval barracks; the garrison
hospital, Melville hospital for sailors and marines, the arsenal,
gymnasium, various military schools, convict prison, and finally
the extensive dockyard system for which the town is famous.
This dockyard covers an area of 516 acres, and has a river
frontage of over 3 m. It was brought into its present state by
the extensive works begun about 1867. Before that time there
was no basin or wet-dock, though the river Medway to some
extent answered the same purpose, but a portion of the adjoining
salt-marshes was then taken in, and three basins have been
constructed, communicating with each other by means of large
locks, so that ships can pass from the bend of the Medway at
Gillingham to that at Upnor. Four graving docks were also
formed, opening out of the first (Upnor) basin. Subsequent
improvements included dredging operations in the Medway to
improve the approach, and the provision of extra dry-dock
accommodation under the Naval Works Acts.</p>

<p>The parliamentary borough returns one member. The town
was incorporated in 1890, and is governed by a mayor, six aldermen
and eighteen councillors. Area, 4355 acres. The borough
includes the suburb (an ecclesiastical parish) of Luton, in which
are the waterworks of Chatham and the adjoining towns.</p>

<p>Chatham (<i>Ceteham, Chetham</i>) belonged at the time of the
Domesday Survey to Odo, bishop of Bayeux. During the
middle ages it formed a suburb of Rochester, but Henry VIII.
in founding a regular navy began to establish dockyards, and the
harbour formed by the deep channel of the Medway was utilized
by Elizabeth, who built a dockyard and established an arsenal
here. The dockyard was altered and improved by Charles I.
and Charles II., and became the chief naval station of England.
In 1708 an act was passed for extending the fortifications of
Chatham. During the excavations on Chatham Hill after 1758 a
number of tumuli containing human remains, pottery, coins, &amp;c.,
suggestive of an ancient settlement, were found. Chatham was
constituted a parliamentary borough by the Reform Bill of 1832.
In the time of Edward III. the lord of the manor had two fairs,
one on the 24th of August and the other on the 8th of September.
A market to be held on Tuesday, and a fair on the 4th, 5th and
6th of May, were granted by Charles II. in 1679, and another
provision market on Saturday by James II. in 1688. In 1738
fairs were held on the 4th of May and the 8th of September, and
a market every Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATHAM ISLANDS<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span>, a small group in the Pacific Ocean,
forming part of New Zealand, 536 m. due E. of Lyttelton in the
South Island, about 44° S., 177° W. It consists of three
islands, a large one called Whairikauri, or Chatham Island, a
smaller one, Rangihaute, or Pitt Island, and a third, Rangatira,
or South-east Island. There are also several small rocky islets.
Whairikauri, whose highest point reaches about 1000 ft., is
remarkable for the number of lakes and tarns it contains, and for
the extensive bogs which cover the surface of nearly the whole
of the uplands. It is of very irregular form, about 38 m. in
length and 25 m. in extreme breadth, with an area of 321 sq. m.&mdash;a
little larger than Middlesex. The geological formation is
principally of volcanic rocks, with schists and tertiary limestone;
and an early physical connexion of the islands with New Zealand
is indicated by their geology and biology. The climate is colder
than that of New Zealand. In the centre of Whairikauri is a
large brackish lake called Tewanga, which at the southern end
is separated from the sea by a sandbank only 150 yds. wide, which
it occasionally bursts through. The southern part of the island
has an undulating surface, and is covered either with an open
forest or with high ferns. In general the soil is extremely fertile,
and where it is naturally drained a rich vegetation of fern and
flax occurs. On the north-west are several conical hills of basalt,
which are surrounded by oases of fertile soil. On the south-western
side is Petre Bay, on which, at the mouth of the river
Mantagu, is Waitangi, the principal settlement.</p>

<p>The islands were discovered in 1791 by Lieutenant W.R.
Broughton (1762-1821), who gave them the name of Chatham
from the brig which he commanded. He described the natives
as a bright, pleasure-loving people, dressed in sealskins or mats,
and calling themselves Morioris or Maiorioris. In 1831 they
were conquered by 800 Maoris who were landed from a European
vessel. They were almost exterminated, and an epidemic of
influenza in 1839 killed half of those left; ten years later there
were only 90 survivors out of a total population of 1200. They
subsequently decreased still further. Their language was allied
to that of the Maoris of New Zealand, but they differed somewhat
from them in physique, and they were probably a cross between
an immigrating Polynesian group and a lower indigenous Melanesian
stock. The population of the islands includes about 200
whites of various races and the same number of natives (chiefly
Maoris). Cattle and sheep are bred, and a trade is carried on in
them with the whalers which visit these seas. The chief export
from the group is wool, grown upon runs farmed both by Europeans
and Morioris. There is also a small export by the natives
of the flesh of young albatrosses and other sea-birds, boiled down
and cured, for the Maoris of New Zealand, by whom it is reckoned
a delicacy. The imports consist of the usual commodities
required by a population where little of the land is actually
cultivated.</p>

<p>There are no indigenous mammals; the reptiles belong to
New Zealand species. The birds&mdash;the largest factor in the fauna&mdash;have
become very greatly reduced through the introduction
of cats, dogs and pigs, as well as by the constant persecution of
every sort of animal by the natives. The larger bell-bird (<i>Anthornis
melanocephala</i>) has become quite scarce; the magnificent
fruit-pigeon (<i>Carpophaga chathamensis</i>), and the two endemic
rails (<i>Nesolimnas dieffenbachii</i> and <i>Cabalus modestus</i>), the one of
which was confined to Whairikauri and the other to Mangare
Island, are extinct. Several fossil or subfossil avian forms, very
interesting from the point of view of geographical distribution,
have been discovered by Dr H.O. Forbes, namely, a true species
of raven (<i>Palaeocorax moriorum</i>), a remarkable rail (<i>Diaphorapteryx</i>),
closely related to the extinct <i>Aphanapteryx</i> of Mauritius,
and a large coot (<i>Palaeolimnas chathamensis</i>). There have also
been discovered the remains of a species of swan belonging to
the South American genus <i>Chenopis</i>, and of the tuatara (<i>Hatteria</i>)
lizard, the unique species of an ancient family now surviving only
in New Zealand. The swan is identical with an extinct species
found in caves and kitchen-middens in New Zealand, which was
contemporaneous with the prehistoric Maoris and was largely
used by them for food. One of the finest of the endemic flowering
plants of the group is the boraginaceous &ldquo;Chatham Island
lily&rdquo; (<i>Myositidium nobile</i>), a gigantic forget-me-not, which grows
on the shingly shore in a few places only, and always just on
the high-water mark, where it is daily deluged by the waves;
while dracophyllums, leucopogons and arborescent ragworts are
characteristic forms in the vegetation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTILLON<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span>, the name of a French family whose history has
furnished material for a large volume in folio by A. du Chesne,
a learned Frenchman, published in 1621. But in spite of its
merits this book presents a certain number of inaccurate statements,
some of which it is important to notice. If, for instance,
it be true that the Châtillons came from Châtillon-sur-Marne
(Marne, arrondissement of Reims), it is now certain that, since
the 11th century, this castle belonged to the count of Champagne,
and that the head of the house of Châtillon was merely
tenant in that place. One of them, however, Gaucher of Châtillon,
lord of Crécy and afterwards constable of France, became in
1290 lord of Châtillon-sur-Marne by exchange, but since 1303 a
new agreement allotted to him the countship of Porcien, while
Châtillon reverted to the domain of the counts of Champagne.
It may be well to mention also that, in consequence of a resemblance
of their armorial bearings, du Chesne considered wrongly
that the lords of Bazoches and those of Château-Porcien of the
12th and 13th centuries drew their descent from the house of
Châtillon.</p>

<p>The most important branches of the house of Châtillon were
those of (1) St Pol, beginning with Gaucher III. of Châtillon,
who became count of St Pol in right of his wife Isabella in 1205,
the last male of the line being Guy V. (d. 1360); (2) Blois,
founded by the marriage of Hugh of Châtillon-St Pol (d. 1248)
with Mary, daughter of Margaret of Blois (d. 1230),&mdash;this branch
became extinct with the death of Guy II. in 1397; (3) Porcien,
from 1303 to 1400, when Count John sold the countship to Louis,
duke of Orleans; (4) Penthièvre, by the marriage of Charles of
Blois (d. 1364) with Jeanne (d. 1384), heiress of Guy, count of
Penthièvre (d. 1331), the male line becoming extinct in 1457.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÂTILLON-SUR-SEINE<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span>, a town of eastern France, capital
of an arrondissement in the department of Côte-d&rsquo;Or, on the
Eastern and Paris-Lyon railways, 67 m. N.N.W. of Dijon,
between that city and Troyes. Pop. (1906) 4430. It is situated
on both banks of the upper Seine, which is swelled at its
entrance to the town by the Douix, one of the most abundant
springs in France. Châtillon is constructed on ample lines and
rendered attractive by beautiful promenades. Some ruins on
an eminence above it mark the site of a château of the dukes of
Burgundy. Near by stands the church of St Vorle of the l0th
century, but with many additions of later date; it contains a
sculptured Holy Sepulchre of the 16th century and a number of
frescoes. In a fine park stands a modern château built by
Marshal Marmont, duke of Ragusa, born at Châtillon in 1774.
It was burnt in 1871, and subsequently rebuilt. The town
preserves several interesting old houses. Châtillon has a sub-prefecture,
tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a school
of agriculture and a communal college. Among its industries
are brewing, iron-founding and the manufacture of mineral and
other blacks. It has trade in wood, charcoal, lithographic and
other stone. Châtillon anciently consisted of two parts, Chaumont,
belonging to the duchy of Burgundy, and Bourg, ruled by
the bishop of Langres; it did not coalesce into one town till the
end of the 16th century. It was taken by the English in 1360 and
by Louis XI. in 1475, during his struggle with Charles the Bold.
Châtillon was one of the first cities to adhere to the League, but
suffered severely from the oppression of its garrisons and governors,
and in 1595 made voluntary submission to Henry IV. In
modern times it is associated with the abortive conference of
1814 between the representatives of Napoleon and the Allies.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATSWORTH<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span>, a village of Derbyshire, England, containing
a seat belonging to the duke of Devonshire, one of the most
splendid private residences in England. Chatsworth House is
situated close to the left bank of the river Derwent, 2¾ m. from
Bakewell. It is Ionic in style, built foursquare, and enclosing a
large open courtyard, with a fountain in the centre. In front,
a beautiful stretch of lawn slopes gradually down to the riverside,
and a bridge, from which may best be seen the grand façade of
the building, as it stands out in relief against the wooded ridge
of Bunker&rsquo;s Hill. The celebrated gardens are adorned with
sculptures by Gabriel Gibber; Sir Joseph Paxton designed the
great conservatory, unrivalled in Europe, which covers an acre;
and the fountains, which include one with a jet 260 ft. high, are
said to be surpassed only by those at Versailles. Within the
house there is a very fine collection of pictures, including the
well-known portraits by Reynolds of Georgiana, duchess of
Devonshire. Other paintings are ascribed to Holbein, Dürer,
Murillo, Jan van Eyck, Dolci, Veronese and Titian. Hung in the
gallery of sketches there are some priceless drawings attributed
to Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raffaelle, Correggio, Titian
and other old masters. Statues by Canova, Thorwaldsen,
Chantrey and R.J. Wyatt are included among the sculptures.
In the state apartments the walls and window-panes are in some
cases inlaid with marble or porphyry; the woodcarving, marvellous
for its intricacy, grace and lightness of effect, is largely
the work of Samuel Watson of Heanor (d. 1715). Chatsworth
Park is upwards of 11 m. in circuit, and contains many noble
forest-trees, the whole being watered by the Derwent, and
surrounded by high moors and uplands. Beyond the river, and
immediately opposite the house, stands the model village of
Edensor, where most of the cottages were built in villa style, with
gardens, by order of the 6th duke. The parish church, restored
by the same benefactor, contains an old brass in memory of
John Beaton, confidential servant to Mary, queen of Scots, who
died in 1570; and in the churchyard are the graves of Lord
Frederick Cavendish, murdered in 1882 in Phoenix Park,
Dublin, and of Sir Joseph Paxton.</p>

<p>Chatsworth (<i>Chetsvorde</i>, <i>Chetelsvorde</i>, &ldquo;the court of Chetel&rdquo;)
took its name from Chetel, one of its Saxon owners, who held it
of Edward the Confessor. It belonged to the crown and was
entrusted by the Conqueror to the custody of William Peverell.
Chatsworth afterwards belonged for many generations to the
family of Leech, and was purchased in the reign of Elizabeth
by Sir William Cavendish, husband of the famous Bess of
Hardwick. In 1557 he began to build Chatsworth House, and
it was completed after his death by his widow, then countess of
Shrewsbury. Here Mary, queen of Scots, spent several years of
her imprisonment under the care of the earl of Shrewsbury.
During the Civil War, Chatsworth was occasionally occupied
as a fortress by both parties. It was pulled down, and the
present house begun by William, 1st duke of Devonshire in 1688.
The little village consists almost exclusively of families employed
upon the estate.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATTANOOGA<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span>, a city and the county-seat of Hamilton
county, Tennessee, U.S.A., in the S.E. part of the state, about
300 m. S. of Cincinnati, Ohio, and 150 m. S.E. of Nashville,
Tennessee, on the Tennessee river, and near the boundary line
between Tennessee and Georgia. Pop. (1860) 2545; (1870)
6093; (1880) 12,892; (1890) 29,100; (1900) 30,154, of whom 994
were foreign-born and 13,122 were negroes; (U.S. census, 1910)
44,604. The city is served by the Alabama Great Southern (Queen
and Crescent), the Cincinnati Southern (leased by the Cincinnati,
New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific railway company), the Nashville,
Chattanooga &amp; St Louis (controlled by the Louisville &amp; Nashville),
and its leased line, the Western &amp; Atlantic (connecting
with Atlanta, Ga.), the Central of Georgia, and the Chattanooga
Southern railways, and by freight and passenger steamboat
lines on the Tennessee river, which is navigable to and beyond
this point during eight months of the year. That branch of
the Southern railway extending from Chattanooga to Memphis
was formerly the Memphis &amp; Charleston, under which name it
became famous in the American Civil War. Chattanooga
occupies a picturesque site at a sharp bend of the river. To the
south lies Lookout Mountain, whose summit (2126 ft. above the
sea; 1495 ft. above the river) commands a magnificent view.
To the east rises Missionary Ridge. Fine driveways and electric
lines connect with both Lookout Mountain (the summit of which
is reached by an inclined plane on which cars are operated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
cable) and Missionary Ridge, where there are Federal reservations,
as well as with the National Military Park (15 sq. m.;
dedicated 1895) on the battlefield of Chickamauga (<i>q.v.</i>); this
park was one of the principal mobilization camps of the United
States army during the Spanish-American War of 1898. Among
the principal buildings are the city hall, the Federal building,
the county court house, the public library, the high school and
the St Vincent&rsquo;s and the Baroness Erlanger hospitals. Among
Chattanooga&rsquo;s educational institutions are two commercial
colleges, the Chattanooga College for Young Ladies (non-sectarian),
the Chattanooga Normal University, and the University
of Chattanooga, until June 1907, United States Grant
University (whose preparatory department, &ldquo;The Athens
School,&rdquo; is at Athens, Tenn.), a co-educational institution under
Methodist Episcopal control, established in 1867; it has a school
of law (1899), a medical school (1889), and a school of theology
(1888). East of the city is a large national cemetery containing
more than 13,000 graves of Federal soldiers. Chattanooga is
an important produce, lumber, coal and iron market, and is the
principal trade and jobbing centre for a large district in Eastern
Tennessee and Northern Georgia and Alabama. The proximity
of coalfields and iron mines has made Chattanooga an iron
manufacturing place of importance, its plants including car
shops, blast furnaces, foundries, agricultural implement and
machinery works, and stove factories; the city has had an
important part in the development of the iron and steel industries
in this part of the South. There are also flour mills, tanneries
(United States Leather Co.), patent medicine, furniture, coffin,
woodenware and wagon factories, knitting and spinning mills,
planing mills, and sash, door and blind factories&mdash;the lumber
being obtained from logs floated down the river and by rail. The
value of the city&rsquo;s factory products increased from $10,517,886
in 1900 to $15,193,909 in 1905 or 44.5%.</p>

<p>Chattanooga was first settled about 1835, and was long known
as Ross&rsquo;s Landing. It was incorporated in 1851 as Chattanooga,
and received a city charter in 1866. Its growth for the three
decades after the Civil War was very rapid. During the American
Civil War it was one of the most important strategic points in
the Confederacy, and in its immediate vicinity were fought two
great battles. During June 1862 it was threatened by a Federal
force under General O.M. Mitchel, but the Confederate army
of General Braxton Bragg was transferred thither by rail from
Corinth, Miss., before Mitchel was able to advance. In
September 1863, however, General W.S. Rosecrans, with the
Union Army of the Cumberland out-man&oelig;uvred Bragg, concentrated
his numerous columns in the Chickamauga Valley, and
occupied the town, to which, after the defeat of Chickamauga
(<i>q.v.</i>), he retired.</p>

<p>From the end of September to the 24th of November the Army
of the Cumberland was then invested in Chattanooga by the
Confederates, whose position lay along Missionary Ridge from
its north end near the river towards Rossville, whence their
entrenchments extended westwards to Lookout Mountain, which
dominates the whole ground, the Tennessee running directly
beneath it. Thus Rosecrans was confined to a semicircle of
low ground around Chattanooga itself, and his supplies had to
make a long and difficult <i>détour</i> from Bridgeport, the main road
being under fire from the Confederate position on Lookout and
in the Wauhatchie valley adjacent. Bragg indeed expected that
Rosecrans would be starved into retreat. But the Federals once
more, and this time on a far larger scale, concentrated in the face
of the enemy. The XI. and XII. corps from Virginia under
Hooker were transferred by rail to reinforce Rosecrans; other
troops were called up from the Mississippi, and on the 16th of
October the Federal government reconstituted the western
armies under the supreme command of General Grant. The
XV. corps of the Army of the Tennessee, under Sherman, was
on the march from the Mississippi. Hooker&rsquo;s troops had already
arrived when Grant reached Chattanooga on the 23rd of October.
The Army of the Cumberland was now under Thomas, Rosecrans
having been recalled. The first action was fought at Brown&rsquo;s
Ferry in the Wauhatchie valley, where Hooker executed with
complete precision a plan for the revictualling of Chattanooga,
established himself near Wauhatchie on the 28th, and repulsed
a determined attack on the same night. But Sherman was still
far distant, and the Federal forces at Knoxville, against which
a large detachment of Bragg&rsquo;s army under Longstreet was now
sent, were in grave danger. Grant waited for Sherman&rsquo;s four
divisions, but prepared everything for battle in the meantime.
His plan was that Thomas in the Chattanooga lines should
contain the Confederate centre on Missionary Ridge, while
Hooker on the right at Wauhatchie was to attack Lookout
Mountain, and Sherman farther up the river was to carry out
the decisive attack against Bragg&rsquo;s extreme right wing at the
end of Missionary Ridgg. The last marches of the XV. corps
were delayed, by stormy weather, Bragg reinforced Longstreet,
and telegraphic communication between Grant and the Federals
at Knoxville had already ceased. But Grant would not move
forward without Sherman, and the battle of Chattanooga was
fought more than two months after Chickamauga. On the 23rd
of November a forward move of Thomas&rsquo;s army, intended as a
demonstration, developed into a serious and successful action,
whereby the first line of the Confederate centre was driven in
for some distance. Bragg was now much weakened by successive
detachments having been sent to Knoxville, and on the 24th the
real battle began. Sherman&rsquo;s corps was gradually brought over
the river near the mouth of Chickamauga Creek, and formed up
on the east side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img style="border:0; width:630px; height:648px"
     src="images/img8.jpg"
     alt="" />
</div>

<p>The attack began at 1 P.M. and was locally a complete success.
The heights attacked were in Sherman&rsquo;s hands, and fortified
against counter-attack, before nightfall. Hooker in the meanwhile
had fought the &ldquo;Battle above the Clouds&rdquo; on the steep
face of Lookout Mountain, and though opposed by an equal
force of Confederates, had completely driven the enemy from
the mountain. The 24th then had been a day of success for the
Federals, and the decisive attack of the three armies in concert
was to take place on the 25th. But the maps deceived Grant
and Sherman as they had previously deceived Rosecrans.
Sherman had captured, not the north point of Missionary Ridge,
but a detached hill, and a new and more serious action had to be
fought for the possession of Tunnel Hill, where Bragg&rsquo;s right now
lay strongly entrenched. The Confederates used every effort to
hold the position and all Sherman&rsquo;s efforts were made in vain.
Hooker, who was moving on Rossville, had not progressed far,
and Bragg was still free to reinforce his right. Grant therefore
directed Thomas to move forward on the centre to relieve the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
pressure on Sherman. The Army of the Cumberland was, after
all, to strike the decisive blow. About 3.30 P.M. the centre
advanced on the Confederate&rsquo;s trenches at the foot of Missionary
Ridge. These were carried at the first rush, and the troops were
ordered to lie down and await orders. Then occurred one of
the most dramatic episodes of the war. Suddenly, and without
orders either from Grant or the officers at the front, the whole
line of the Army of the Cumberland rose and rushed up the ridge.
Two successive lines of entrenchments were carried at once.
In a short time the crest was stormed, and after a last attempt
at resistance the enemy&rsquo;s centre fled in the wildest confusion.
The pursuit was pressed home by the divisional generals, notably
by Sheridan. Hooker now advanced in earnest on Rossville,
and by nightfall the whole Confederate army, except the troops
on Tunnel Hill, was retreating in disorder. These too were
withdrawn in the night, and the victory of the Federals was
complete. Bragg lost 8684 men killed, wounded and prisoners
out of perhaps 34,000 men engaged; Grant, with 60,000 men,
lost about 6000.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATTEL<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (for derivation see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cattle</a></span>), a term used in English
law as equivalent to &ldquo;personal property,&rdquo; that is, property
which, on the death of the owner, devolves on his executor or
administrator to be distributed (unless disposed of by will)
among the next of kin according to the Statutes of Distributions.
Chattels are divided into <i>chattels real</i> and <i>chattels personal</i>.
Chattels real are those interests in land for which no &ldquo;real
action&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Action</a></span>) lies; estates which are less than freehold
(estates for years, at will, or by sufferance) are chattels real.
Chattels personal are such things as belong immediately to the
person of the owner, and for which, if they are injuriously
withheld from him, he has no remedy other than by a personal
action. Chattels personal are divided into <i>choses in possession</i>
and <i>choses in action</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chose</a></span>).</p>

<p>A chattel mortgage, in United States law, is a transfer of
personal property as security for a debt or obligation in such
form that the title to the property will pass to the mortgagee
upon the failure of the mortgagor to comply with the terms of
the contract. At common law a chattel mortgage might be
made without writing, and was valid as between the parties,
and even as against third parties if accompanied by possession
in the mortgagee, but in most states of the Union legislation
now requires a chattel mortgage to be in writing and duly
recorded in order to be valid against third parties. At common
law a mortgage can be given only of chattels actually in existence
and belonging to the mortgagor, though if he acquired title
afterwards the mortgage would be good as between the parties,
but not as against subsequent purchasers or creditors. In
equity, on the other hand, a chattel mortgage, though not good
as a conveyance, is valid as an executory agreement.</p>

<p><i>Goods and chattels</i> is a phrase which, in its widest signification,
includes any property other than freehold. The two words,
however, have come to be synonymous, and the expression,
now practically confined to wills, means merely things movable
in possession.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATTERJI, BANKIM CHANDRA<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> [<span class="sc">Bankimachandra
Chatt&#256;radh-y&#256;ya</span>] (1838-1894), Indian novelist, was born in
the district of the Twenty-four Parganas in Bengal on the 27th
of June 1838, and was by caste a Brahman. He was educated
at the Hugli College, at the Presidency College in Calcutta, and
at Calcutta University, where he was the first to take the degree
of B.A. (1858). He entered the Indian civil service, and served
as deputy magistrate in various districts of Bengal, his official
services being recognized, on his retirement in 1891, by the
title of rai bahadur and the C.I.E. He died on the 8th of April
1894.</p>

<p>Bankim Chandra was beyond question the greatest novelist
of India during the 19th century, whether judged by the amount
and quality of his writings, or by the influence which they have
continued to exercise. His education had brought him into
touch with the works of the great European romance writers,
notably Sir Walter Scott, and he created in India a school of
fiction on the European model. His first historical novel, the
<i>Durges-Nandini</i> or <i>Chief&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, modelled on Scott, made
a great sensation in Bengal; and the <i>Kapala-Kundala</i> and
<i>Mrinalini</i>, which followed it, established his fame as a writer
whose creative imagination and power of delineation had <span class="correction" title="amended from 'social'">never</span>
been surpassed in India. In 1872 he brought out his first <span class="correction" title="amended from 'never'">social</span>
novel, the <i>Biska-Brikkha</i> or <i>Poison Tree</i>, which was followed by
others in rapid succession. It is impossible to exaggerate the
effect they produced; for over twenty years Bankim Chandra&rsquo;s
novels were eagerly read by the educated public of Bengal,
including the Hindu ladies in the zenanas; and though numerous
works of fiction are now produced year by year in every province
of India, his influence has increased rather than diminished.
Of all his works, however, by far the most important from its
astonishing political consequences was the <i>Ananda Math</i>, which
was published in 1882, about the time of the agitation arising
out of the Ilbert Bill. The story deals with the Sannyasi (i.e.
fakir or hermit) rebellion of 1772 near Purmea, Tirhut and
Dinapur, and its culminating episode is a crushing victory won
by the rebels over the united British and Mussulman forces,
a success which was not, however, followed up, owing to the
advice of a mysterious &ldquo;physician&rdquo; who, speaking as a divinely-inspired
prophet, advises Satyananda, the leader of &ldquo;the
children of the Mother,&rdquo; to abandon further resistance, since a
temporary submission to British rule is a necessity; for Hinduism
has become too speculative and unpractical, and the mission of
the English in India is to teach Hindus how to reconcile theory
and speculation with the facts of science. The general moral
of the <i>Ananda Math</i>, then, is that British rule and British
education are to be accepted as the only alternative to Mussulman
oppression, a moral which Bankim Chandra developed also in
his <i>Dharmatattwa</i>, an elaborate religious treatise in which he
explained his views as to the changes necessary in the moral and
religious condition of his fellow-countrymen before they could
hope to compete on equal terms with the British and Mahommedans.
But though the <i>Ananda Math</i> is in form an apology
for the loyal acceptance of British rule, it is none the less inspired
by the ideal of the restoration, sooner or later, of a Hindu
kingdom in India. This is especially evident in the occasional
verses in the book, of which the <i>Bande Mataram</i> is the most
famous.</p>

<p>As to the exact significance of this poem a considerable
controversy has raged. <i>Bande Mataram</i> is the Sanskrit for
&ldquo;Hail to thee, Mother!&rdquo; or more literally &ldquo;I reverence thee,
Mother!&rdquo;, and according to Dr G.A. Grierson (<i>The Times</i>,
Sept. 12, 1906) it can have no other possible meaning than an
invocation of one of the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; goddesses of Hinduism, in
his opinion Kali &ldquo;the goddess of death and destruction.&rdquo; Sir
Henry Cotton, on the other hand (ib. Sept. 13, 1906), sees in
it merely an invocation of the &ldquo;mother-land&rdquo; Bengal, and
quotes in support of this view the free translation of the poem
by the late W.H. Lee, a proof which, it may be at once said,
is far from convincing. But though, as Dr Grierson points out,
the idea of a &ldquo;mother-land&rdquo; is wholly alien to Hindu ideas, it is
quite possible that Bankim Chandra may have assimilated it
with his European culture, and the true explanation is probably
that given by Mr J.D. Anderson in <i>The Times</i> of September 24,
1906. He points out that in the 11th chapter of the 1st book of
the <i>Ananda Math</i> the Sannyasi rebels are represented as having
erected, in addition to the image of Kali, &ldquo;the Mother who Has
Been,&rdquo; a white marble statue of &ldquo;the Mother that Shall Be,&rdquo;
which &ldquo;is apparently a representation of the mother-land.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
The <i>Bande Mataram</i> hymn is apparently addressed to both
idols.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poem, then, is the work of a Hindu idealist who personified
Bengal under the form of a purified and spiritualized Kali.
Of its thirty-six lines, partly written in Sanskrit, partly in
Bengali, the greater number are harmless enough. But if the
poet sings the praise of the &ldquo;Mother&rdquo;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;As Lachmi, bowered in the flower</p>
<p class="i05">That in the water grows,&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">he also praises her as &ldquo;Durga, bearing ten weapons,&rdquo; and lines
10, 11 and 12 are capable of very dangerous meanings in the
mouths of unscrupulous agitators. Literally translated these
run, &ldquo;She has seventy millions of throats to sing her praise,
twice seventy millions of hands to fight for her, how then
is Bengal powerless?&rdquo; As S.M. Mitra points out (<i>Indian
Problems</i>, London, 1908), this language is the more significant
as the <i>Bande Mataram</i> in the novel was the hymn by singing
which the Sannyasis gained strength when attacking the British
forces.</p>

<p>During Bankim Chandra Chatterji&rsquo;s lifetime the <i>Bande
Mataram</i>, though its dangerous tendency was recognized, was
not used as a party war-cry; it was not raised, for instance,
during the Ilbert Bill agitation, nor by the students who flocked
round the court during the trial of Surendra Nath Banerji in
1883. It has, however, obtained an evil notoriety in the agitations
that followed the partition of Bengal. That Bankim
Chandra himself foresaw or desired any such use of it is impossible
to believe. According to S.M. Mitra, he composed it &ldquo;in a fit
of patriotic excitement after a good hearty dinner, which he
always enjoyed. It was set to Hindu music, known as the
<i>Mallar-Kawali-Tal</i>. The extraordinarily stirring character of
the air, and its ingenious assimilation of Bengali passages with
Sanskrit, served to make it popular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Circumstances have made the <i>Bande Mataram</i> the most
famous and the most widespread in its effects of Bankim
Chandra&rsquo;s literary works. More permanent, it may be hoped,
was the wholesome influence he exercised on the number of
literary men he gathered round him, who have left their impress
on the literature of Bengal. In his earlier years he served
his apprenticeship in literature under Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar,
the chief poet and satirist of Bengal during the earlier half of the
19th century. Bankim Chandra&rsquo;s friend and colleague, Dina
Bandhu Mitra, was virtually the founder of the modern Bengali
drama. Another friend of his, Hem Chandra Banerji, was a poet
of recognized merit and talent. And among the younger men
who venerated Bankim Chandra, and benefited by his example
and advice, may be mentioned two distinguished poets, Nalein
Chandra Sen and Rabindra Nath Tagore.</p>

<p>Of Bankim Chandra&rsquo;s novels some have been translated into
English by H.A.D. Phillips and by Mrs M.S. Knight.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHATTERTON, THOMAS<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1752-1770), English poet, was born
at Bristol on the 20th of November 1752. His pedigree has a
curious significance. The office of sexton of St Mary Redcliffe,
at Bristol, one of the most beautiful parish churches in England,
had been transmitted for nearly two centuries in the Chatterton
family; and throughout the brief life of the poet it was
held by his uncle, Richard Phillips. The poet&rsquo;s father, Thomas
Chatterton, was a musical genius, somewhat of a poet, a numismatist,
and a dabbler in occult arts. He was one of the sub-chanters
of Bristol cathedral, and master of the Pyle Street free
school, near Redcliffe church. But whatever hereditary tendencies
may have been transmitted from the father, the sole
training of the boy necessarily devolved on his mother, who was
in the fourth month of her widowhood at the time of his birth.
She established a girls&rsquo; school, took in sewing and ornamental
needlework, and so brought up her two children, a girl and a
boy, till the latter attained his eighth year, when he was admitted
to Colston&rsquo;s Charity. But the Bristol blue-coat school, in which
the curriculum was limited to reading, writing, arithmetic and
the Church Catechism, had little share in the education of its
marvellous pupil. The hereditary race of sextons had come to
regard the church of St Mary Redcliffe as their own peculiar
domain; and, under the guidance of his uncle, the child found
there his favourite haunt. The knights, ecclesiastics and civic
dignitaries, recumbent on its altar tombs, became his familiar
associates; and by and by, when he was able to spell his way
through the inscriptions graven on their monuments, he found
a fresh interest in certain quaint oaken chests in the muniment
room over the porch on the north side of the nave, where parchment
deeds, old as the Wars of the Roses, long lay unheeded
and forgotten. They formed the child&rsquo;s playthings almost from
his cradle. He learned his first letters from the illuminated
capitals of an old musical folio, and learned to read out of a
black-letter Bible. He did not like, his sister said, reading out
of small books. Wayward, as it seems, almost from his earliest
years, and manifesting no sympathy with the ordinary pastimes
of children, he was regarded for a time as deficient in intellect.
But he was even then ambitious of distinction. His sister relates
that on being asked what device he would like painted on a bowl
that was to be his, he replied, &ldquo;Paint me an angel, with wings,
and a trumpet, to trumpet my name over the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From his earliest years he was liable to fits of abstraction,
sitting for hours in seeming stupor, or yielding after a time to
tears, for which he would assign no reason. He had no one near
him to sympathize in the strange world of fancy which his
imagination had already called into being; and circumstances
helped to foster his natural reserve, and to beget that love of
mystery which exercised so great an influence on the development
of his genius. When the strange child had attained his
sixth year his mother began to recognize his capacity; at eight
he was so eager for books that he would read and write all day
long if undisturbed; and in his eleventh year he had become a
contributor to <i>Felix Farley&rsquo;s Bristol Journal</i>. The occasion of
his confirmation inspired some religious poems published in this
paper. In 1763 a beautiful cross of curious workmanship, which
had adorned the churchyard of St Mary Redcliffe for upwards of
three centuries, was destroyed by a churchwarden. The spirit
of veneration was strong in the boy, and he sent to the local
journal on the 7th of January 1764 a clever satire on the parish
Vandal. But his delight was to lock himself in a little attic
which he had appropriated as his study; and there, with books,
cherished parchments, saved from the loot of the muniment room
of St Mary Redcliffe, and drawing materials, the child lived in
thought with his 15th-century heroes and heroines. The first of
his literary mystifications, the duologue of &ldquo;Elinoure and Juga,&rdquo;
was written before he was twelve years old, and he showed his
poem to the usher at Colston&rsquo;s hospital, Thomas Phillips, as the
work of a 15th-century poet.</p>

<p>Chatterton remained an inmate of Colston&rsquo;s hospital for
upwards of six years, and the slight advantages gained from
this scanty education are traceable to the friendly sympathy of
Phillips, himself a writer of verse, who encouraged his pupils to
write. Three of Chatterton&rsquo;s companions are named as youths
whom Phillips&rsquo;s taste for poetry stimulated to rivalry; but
Chatterton held aloof from these contests, and made at that
time no confidant of his own more daring literary adventures.
His little pocket-money was spent in borrowing books from a
circulating library; and he early ingratiated himself with book
collectors, by whose aid he found access to Weever, Dugdale
and Collins, as well as to Speght&rsquo;s edition of Chaucer, Spenser
and other books.</p>

<p>His &ldquo;Rowleian&rdquo; jargon appears to have been chiefly the
result of the study of John Kersey&rsquo;s <i>Dictionarium
Anglo-Britannicum,</i> and Prof. W. W. Skeat seems to think his
knowledge of even Chaucer was very slight. His holidays were mostly
spent at his mother&rsquo;s house; and much of them in the favourite
retreat of his attic study there. He had already conceived the
romance of Thomas Rowley, an imaginary monk of the 15th
century, and lived for the most part in an ideal world of his own,
in that elder time when Edward IV. was England&rsquo;s king, and
Master William Canynge&mdash;familiar to him among the recumbent
effigies in Redcliffe church&mdash;still ruled in Bristol&rsquo;s civic
chair. Canynge is represented as an enlightened patron of
literature, and Rowley&rsquo;s dramatic interludes were written for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
performance at his house. In order to escape a marriage urged
by the king, Canynge retired to the college of Westbury in
Gloucestershire, where he enjoyed the society of Rowley, and
eventually became dean of the institution. In &ldquo;The Storie of
William Canynge,&rdquo; one of the shorter pieces of his ingenious
romance, his early history is recorded.</p>

<p>This beautiful picture of the childhood of the ideal patron of
Rowley is in reality that of the poet himself&mdash;&ldquo;the fate-marked
babe,&rdquo; with his wondrous child-genius, and all his romantic
dreams realized. The literary masquerade which thus constituted
the life-dream of the boy was wrought out by him in
fragments of prose and verse into a coherent romance, until the
credulous scholars and antiquaries of his day were persuaded
into the belief that there had lain in the parish chest of Redcliffe
church for upwards of three centuries, a collection of MSS. of
rare merit, the work of Thomas Rowley, an unknown priest of
Bristol in the days of Henry VI. and his poet laureate, John
Lydgate.</p>

<p>Among the Bristol patrons of Chatterton were two pewterers,
George Catcott and his partner Henry Burgum. Catcott was one
of the most zealous believers in Rowley, and continued to collect
his reputed writings long after the death of their real author.
On Burgum, who had risen in life by his own exertions, the blue-coat
boy palmed off the de Bergham pedigree, and other equally
apocryphal evidences of the pewterer&rsquo;s descent from an ancestry
old as the Norman Conquest. The de Bergham quartering,
blazoned on a piece of parchment doubtless recovered from the
Redcliffe muniment chest, was itself supposed to have lain for
centuries in that ancient depository. The pedigree was professedly
collected by Chatterton from original records, including
&ldquo;The Rowley MSS.&rdquo; The pedigree still exists in Chatterton&rsquo;s
own handwriting, copied into a book in which he had previously
transcribed portions of antique verse, under the title of &ldquo;Poems
by Thomas Rowley, priest of St. John&rsquo;s, in the city of Bristol&rdquo;;
and in one of these, &ldquo;The Tournament,&rdquo; Syrr Johan de Berghamme
plays a conspicuous part. The ennobled pewterer
rewarded Chatterton with five shillings, and was satirized for
this valuation of a noble pedigree in some of Chatterton&rsquo;s
latest verse.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July 1767, Chatterton was transferred to the office
of John Lambert, attorney, to whom he was bound apprentice
as a clerk. There he was left much alone; and after fulfilling
the routine duties devolving on him, he found leisure for his own
favourite pursuits. An ancient stone bridge on the Avon, built
in the reign of Henry II., and altered by many later additions
into a singularly picturesque but inconvenient thoroughfare,
had been displaced by a structure better adapted to modern
requirements. In September 1768, when Chatterton was in the
second year of his apprenticeship, the new bridge was partially
opened for traffic. Shortly afterwards the editor of <i>Felix Farley&rsquo;s
Journal</i> received from a correspondent, signing himself <i>Dunelmus
Bristoliensis</i>, a &ldquo;description of the mayor&rsquo;s first passing over the
old bridge,&rdquo; professedly derived from an ancient MS. William
Barrett, F.S.A., surgeon and antiquary, who was then accumulating
materials for a history of Bristol, secured the original
manuscript, which is now preserved in the British Museum, along
with other Chatterton MSS., most of which were ultimately
incorporated by the credulous antiquary into a learned quarto
volume, entitled the <i>History and Antiquities of the City of Bristol</i>,
published nearly twenty years after the poet&rsquo;s death. It was
at this time that the definite story made its appearance&mdash;over
which critics and antiquaries wrangled for nearly a century&mdash;of
numerous ancient poems and other MSS. taken by the elder
Chatterton from a coffer in the muniment room of Redcliffe
church, and transcribed, and so rescued from oblivion, by his
son. The pieces include the &ldquo;Bristowe Tragedie, or the Dethe
of Syr Charles Bawdin,&rdquo; a ballad celebrating the death of the
Lancastrian knight, Charles Baldwin; &ldquo;Ælla,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Tragycal
Enterlude,&rdquo; as Chatterton styles it, but in reality a dramatic
poem of sustained power and curious originality of structure;
&ldquo;Goddwyn,&rdquo; a dramatic fragment; &ldquo;Tournament,&rdquo; &ldquo;Battle
of Hastings,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Parliament of Sprites,&rdquo; &ldquo;Balade of Charitie,&rdquo;
with numerous shorter pieces, forming altogether a volume of
poetry, the rare merit of which is indisputable, wholly apart from
the fact that it was the production of a mere boy. Unfortunately
for him, his ingenious romance had either to be acknowledged as
his own creation, and so in all probability be treated with contempt,
or it had to be sustained by the manufacture of spurious
antiques. To this accordingly Chatterton resorted, and found
no difficulty in gulling the most learned of his credulous dupes
with his parchments.</p>

<p>The literary labours of the boy, though diligently pursued at
his desk, were not allowed to interfere with the duties of Mr
Lambert&rsquo;s office. Nevertheless the Bristol attorney used to
search his apprentice&rsquo;s drawer, and tear up any poems or other
manuscripts that he could lay his hands upon; so that it was
only during the absences of Mr Lambert from Bristol that he
was able to expend his unemployed time in his favourite pursuits.
But repeated allusions, both by Chatterton and others, seem to
indicate that such intervals of freedom were of frequent occurrence.
Some of his modern poems, such as the piece entitled
&ldquo;Resignation,&rdquo; are of great beauty; and these, with the satires, in
which he took his revenge on all the local celebrities whose
vanity or meanness had excited his ire, are alone sufficient to fill
a volume. The Catcotts, Burgum, Barrett and others of his
patrons, figure in these satires, in imprudent yet discriminating
caricature, along with mayor, aldermen, bishop, dean and other
notabilities of Bristol. Towards Lambert his feelings were of too
keen a nature to find relief in such sarcasm.</p>

<p>In December 1768, in his seventeenth year, he wrote to
Dodsley, the London publisher, offering to procure for him
&ldquo;copies of several ancient poems, and an interlude, perhaps
the oldest dramatic piece extant, wrote by one Rowley, a priest
in Bristol, who lived in the reigns of Henry VI. and Edward IV.&rdquo;
To this letter he appended the initials of his favourite pseudonym,
<i>Dunelmus Bristoliensis</i>, but directed the answer to be sent to
the care of Thomas Chatterton, Redcliffe Hill, Bristol. To this,
as well as to another letter enclosing an extract from the tragedy
of &ldquo;Ælla,&rdquo; no answer appears to have been returned. Chatterton,
conceiving the idea of finding sympathy and aid at the hand
of some modern Canynge, bethought him of Horace Walpole,
who not only indulged in a medieval renaissance of his own, but
was the reputed author of a spurious antique in the <i>Castle of
Otranto</i>. He wrote to him offering him a document entitled
&ldquo;The Ryse of Peyncteyne yn Englande, wroten by T. Rowleie,
1469, for Mastre Canynge,&rdquo; accompanied by notes which included
specimens of Rowley&rsquo;s poetry. To this Walpole replied with
courteous acknowledgments. He characterized the verses as
&ldquo;wonderful for their harmony and spirit,&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;Give me
leave to ask you where Rowley&rsquo;s poems are to be had? I should
not be sorry to print them; or at least a specimen of them, if
they have never been printed.&rdquo; Chatterton replied, enclosing
additional specimens of antique verse, and telling Walpole that
he was the son of a poor widow, and clerk to an attorney, but
had a taste for more refined studies; and he hinted a wish that
he might help him to some more congenial occupation. Walpole&rsquo;s
manner underwent an abrupt change. The specimens of verse
had been submitted to his friends Gray and Mason, the poets,
and pronounced modern. They did not thereby forfeit the
wonderful harmony and spirit which Walpole had already
professed to recognize in them. But he now coldly advised the
boy to stick to the attorney&rsquo;s office; and &ldquo;when he should
have made a fortune,&rdquo; he might betake himself to more favourite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
studies, Chatterton had to write three times before he recovered
his MSS. Walpole has been loaded with more than his just
share of responsibility for the fate of the unhappy poet, of
whom he admitted when too late, &ldquo;I do not believe there ever
existed so masterly a genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chatterton now turned his attention to periodical literature
and politics, and exchanged <i>Felix Farley&rsquo;s Bristol Journal</i> for
the <i>Town and County Magazine</i> and other London periodicals.
Assuming the vein of Junius&mdash;then in the full blaze of his
triumph&mdash;he turned his pen against the duke of Grafton, the
earl of Bute, and the princess of Wales. He had just despatched
one of his political diatribes to the <i>Middlesex Journal</i>, when he
sat down on Easter Eve, I7th April 1770, and penned his &ldquo;Last
Will and Testament,&rdquo; a strange satirical compound of jest and
earnest, in which he intimated his intention of putting an end
to his life the following evening. Among his satirical bequests,
such as his &ldquo;humility&rdquo; to the Rev. Mr Camplin, his &ldquo;religion&rdquo;
to Dean Barton, and his &ldquo;modesty&rdquo; along with his &ldquo;prosody
and grammar&rdquo; to Mr Burgum, he leaves &ldquo;to Bristol all his
spirit and disinterestedness, parcels of goods unknown on its
quay since the days of Canynge and Rowley.&rdquo; In more genuine
earnestness he recalls the name of Michael Clayfield, a friend to
whom he owed intelligent sympathy. The will was probably
purposely prepared in order to frighten his master into letting
him go. If so, it had the desired effect. Lambert cancelled his
indentures; his friends and acquaintance made him up a purse;
and on the 25th or 26th of the month he arrived in London.</p>

<p>Chatterton was already known to the readers of the <i>Middlesex
Journal</i> as a rival of Junius, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of Decimus.
He had also been a contributor to Hamilton&rsquo;s <i>Town and County
Magazine</i>, and speedily found access to the <i>Freeholder&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
another political miscellany strong for Wilkes and liberty. His
contributions were freely accepted; but the editors paid little
or nothing for them. He wrote in the most hopeful terms to his
mother and sister, and spent his first earnings in buying gifts
for them. His pride and ambition were amply gratified by the
promises and interested flattery of editors and political adventurers;
Wilkes himself had noted his trenchant style, &ldquo;and
expressed a desire to know the author&rdquo;; and Lord Mayor
Beckford graciously acknowledged a political address of his,
and greeted him &ldquo;as politely as a citizen could.&rdquo; But of actual
money he received but little. He was extremely abstemious,
his diligence was great, and his versatility wonderful. He could
assume the style of Junius or Smollett, reproduce the satiric
bitterness of Churchill, parody Macpherson&rsquo;s Ossian, or write in
the manner of Pope, or with the polished grace of Gray and
Collins. He wrote political letters, eclogues, lyrics, operas and
satires, both in prose and verse. In June 1770&mdash;after Chatterton
had been some nine weeks in London&mdash;he removed from Shoreditch,
where he had hitherto lodged with a relative, to an attic
in Brook Street, Holborn. But for most of his productions the
payment was delayed; and now state prosecutions of the press
rendered letters in the Junius vein no longer admissible, and
threw him back on the lighter resources of his pen. In Shoreditch,
as in his lodging at the Bristol attorney&rsquo;s, he had only shared a
room; but now, for the first time, he enjoyed uninterrupted
solitude. His bed-fellow at Mr Walmsley&rsquo;s, Shoreditch, noted
that much of the night was spent by him in writing; and now
he could write all night. The romance of his earlier years
revived, and he transcribed from an imaginary parchment of
the old priest Rowley his &ldquo;Excelente Balade of Charitie.&rdquo; This
fine poem, perversely disguised in archaic language, he sent to
the editor of the <i>Town and County Magazine</i>, and had it rejected.</p>

<p>The high hopes of the sanguine boy had begun to fade. He
had not yet completed his second month in London, and already
failure and starvation stared him in the face. Mr Cross, a neighbouring
apothecary, repeatedly invited him to join him at dinner
or supper; but he refused. His landlady also, suspecting his
necessity, pressed him to share her dinner, but in vain. &ldquo;She
knew,&rdquo; as she afterwards said, &ldquo;that he had not eaten anything
for two or three days.&rdquo; But he was offended at her urgency,
and assured her that he was not hungry. The note of his actual
receipts, found in his pocket-book after his death, shows that
Hamilton, Fell and other editors who had been so liberal in
flattery, had paid him at the rate of a shilling for an article, and
somewhat less than eightpence each for his songs; while much
which had been accepted was held in reserve, and still unpaid
for. The beginning of a new month revealed to him the indefinite
postponement of the publication and payment of his work. He
had wished, according to his foster-mother, to study medicine
with Barrett; in his desperation he now reverted to this, and
wrote to Barrett for a letter to help him to an opening as a
surgeon&rsquo;s assistant on board an African trader. He appealed
also to Mr Catcott to forward his plan, but in vain. On the
24th of August 1770, he retired for the last time to his attic in
Brook Street, carrying with him the arsenic which he there
drank, after tearing into fragments whatever literary remains
were at hand.</p>

<p>He was only seventeen years and nine months old; but the
best of his numerous productions, both in prose and verse,
require no allowance to be made for the immature years of their
author, when comparing him with the ablest of his contemporaries.
He pictures Lydgate, the monk of Bury St Edmunds,
challenging Rowley to a trial at versemaking, and under cover
of this fiction, produces his &ldquo;Songe of Ælla,&rdquo; a piece of rare
lyrical beauty, worthy of comparison with any antique or modern
production of its class. Again, in his &ldquo;Tragedy of Goddwyn,&rdquo;
of which only a fragment has been preserved, the &ldquo;Ode to
Liberty,&rdquo; with which it abruptly closes, may claim a place among
the finest martial lyrics in the language. The collection of poems
in which such specimens occur furnishes by far the most remarkable
example of intellectual precocity in the whole history of
letters. Collins, Burns, Keats, Shelley and Byron all awaken
sorrow over the premature arrestment of their genius; but the
youngest of them survived to his twenty-fifth year, while
Chatterton was not eighteen when he perished in his miserable
garret. The death of Chatterton attracted little notice at the
time; for the few who then entertained any appreciative
estimate of the Rowley poems regarded him as their mere
transcriber. He was interred in a burying-ground attached to
Shoe Lane Workhouse, in the parish of St Andrew&rsquo;s, Holborn,
which has since been converted into a site for Farringdon Market.
There is a discredited story that the body of the poet was recovered,
and secretly buried by his uncle, Richard Phillips, in
Redcliffe Churchyard. There a monument has since been erected
to his memory, with the appropriate inscription, borrowed
from his &ldquo;Will,&rdquo; and so supplied by the poet&rsquo;s own pen&mdash;&ldquo;To
the memory of Thomas Chatterton. Reader! judge not. If
thou art a Christian, believe that he shall be judged by a Superior
Power. To that Power only is he now answerable.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;<i>Poems supposed to have been written at Bristol
by Thomas Rowley and others, in the Fifteenth Century</i> (1777) was edited
by Thomas Tyrwhitt; Thomas Warton, in his <i>History of English
Poetry</i> (1778), vol. ii. section viii., gives Rowley a place among the
15th century poets; but neither of these critics believed in the
antiquity of the poems. In 1782 a new edition of Rowley&rsquo;s poems
appeared, with a &ldquo;Commentary, in which the antiquity of them is
considered and defended,&rdquo; by Jeremiah Milles, dean of Exeter.
The controversy which raged round the Rowley poems is discussed
in A. Kippis, <i>Biographia Britannica</i> (vol. iv., 1789), where there is a
detailed account by G. Gregory of Chatterton&rsquo;s life (pp. 573-619).
This was reprinted in the edition (1803) of Chatterton&rsquo;s <i>Works</i> by
R. Southey and J. Cottle, published for the benefit of the poet&rsquo;s
sister. The neglected condition of the study of earlier English in
the 18th century alone accounts for the temporary success of
Chatterton&rsquo;s mystification. It has long been agreed that Chatterton
was solely responsible for the Rowley Poems, but the language and
style are analysed in confirmation of this view by Prof. W.W.
Skeat in an introductory essay prefaced to vol. ii. of <i>The Poetical
Works of Thomas Chatterton</i> (1871) in the &ldquo;Aldine Edition of the
British Poets.&rdquo; This, which is the most convenient edition, also
contains a memoir of the poet by Edward Bell. The spelling of the
Rowley poems is there modernized, and many of the archaic words
are replaced by modern equivalents provided in many cases from
Chatterton&rsquo;s own notes, the theory being that Chatterton usually
composed in modern English, and inserted his peculiar words and
his complicated orthography afterwards. For some criticism of
Prof. Skeat&rsquo;s success in the very difficult task of reconstituting the
text, see H.B. Forman, <i>Thomas Chatterton and his latest Editor</i> (1874).

The Chatterton MSS., originally in the possession of William Barrett
of Bristol, were left by his heir to the British Museum in 1800.
Others are preserved in the Bristol library.</p>

<p>Chatterton&rsquo;s genius and his tragic death are commemorated by
Shelley in <i>Adonais</i>, by Wordsworth in &ldquo;Resolution and Independence,&rdquo;
by Coleridge in &ldquo;A Monody on the Death of Chatterton,&rdquo;
by D.G. Rossetti in &ldquo;Five English Poets,&rdquo; and John Keats inscribed
<i>Endymion</i> &ldquo;to the memory of Thomas Chatterton.&rdquo; Alfred de
Vigny&rsquo;s drama of <i>Chatterton</i> gives an altogether fictitious account of
the poet. Herbert Croft (<i>q.v.</i>), in his <i>Love and Madness</i>, interpolated
a long and valuable account of Chatterton, giving many of the
poet&rsquo;s letters, and much information obtained from his family and
friends (pp. 125-244, letter li.). There is a valuable collection of
&ldquo;Chattertoniana&rdquo; in the British Museum, consisting of separate
works by Chatterton, newspaper cuttings, articles, dealing with the
Rowley controversy and other subjects, with MS. notes by Joseph
Haslewood, and several autograph letters.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUCER, GEOFFREY<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (? 1340-1400), English poet. The
name Chaucer, a French form of the Latin <i>calcearius</i>, a shoe-maker,
is found in London and the eastern counties as early as
the second half of the 13th century. Some of the London
Chaucers lived in Cordwainer Street, in the shoemakers&rsquo; quarter;
several of them, however, were vintners, and among others the
poet&rsquo;s father John, and probably also his grandfather Robert.
Legal pleadings inform us that in December 1324 John Chaucer
was not much over twelve years old, and that he was still unmarried
<span class="sidenote">Life.</span>
in 1328, the year which used to be considered
that of Geoffrey&rsquo;s birth.The poet was probably born
from eight to twelve years later, since in 1386, when giving
evidence in Sir Richard le Scrope&rsquo;s suit against Sir Robert
Grosvenor as to the right to bear certain arms, he was set down
as &ldquo;del age de xl ans et plus, armeez par xxvij ans.&rdquo; At a later
date, and probably at the time of the poet&rsquo;s birth, his father
lived in Thames Street, and had to wife a certain Agnes, niece
of Hamo de Compton, whom we may regard as Geoffrey Chaucer&rsquo;s
mother. In 1357 Geoffrey is found, apparently as a lad, in the
service of Elizabeth, countess of Ulster, wife of Lionel, duke of
Clarence, entries in two leaves of her household accounts,
accidentally preserved, showing that she paid in April, May and
December various small sums for his clothing and expenses.
In 1359, as we learn from his deposition in the Scrope suit, Chaucer
went to the war in France. At some period of the campaign he
was at &ldquo;Retters,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> Rethel, near Reims, and subsequently
had the ill luck to be taken prisoner. On the 1st of March 1360
the king contributed £16 to his ransom, and by a year or two
later Chaucer must have entered the royal service, since on the
20th of June 1367 Edward granted him a pension of twenty
marks for his past and future services. A pension of ten marks
had been granted by the king the previous September to a
Philippa Chaucer for services to the queen as one of her &ldquo;domicellae&rdquo;
or &ldquo;damoiselles,&rdquo; and it seems probable that at this date
Chaucer was already married and this Philippa his wife, a conclusion
which used to be resisted on the ground of allusions in
his early poems to a hopeless love-affair, now reckoned part of
his poetical outfit. Philippa is usually said to have been one of
two daughters of a Sir Payne Roet, the other being Katherine,
who after the death of her first husband, Sir Hugh de Swynford,
in 1372, became governess to John of Gaunt&rsquo;s children, and
subsequently his mistress and (in 1396) his wife. It is possible
that Philippa was sister to Sir Hugh and sister-in-law to
Katherine. In either case the marriage helps to account
for the favour subsequently shown to Chaucer by John of
Gaunt.</p>

<p>In the grant of his pension Chaucer is called &ldquo;dilectus vallectus
noster,&rdquo; our beloved yeoman; before the end of 1368 he had
risen to be one of the king&rsquo;s esquires. In September of the
following year John of Gaunt&rsquo;s wife, the duchess Blanche, died at
the age of twenty-nine, and Chaucer wrote in her honour <i>The
Book of the Duchesse</i>, a poem of 1334 lines in octosyllabic couplets,
the first of his undoubtedly genuine works which can be connected
with a definite date. In June 1370 he went abroad on the king&rsquo;s
service, though on what errand, or whither it took him, is not
known. He was back probably some time before Michaelmas,
and seems to have remained in England till the 1st of December
1372, when he started, with an advance of 100 marks in his
pocket, for Italy, as one of the three commissioners to treat with
the Genoese as to an English port where they might have special
facilities for trade. The accounts which he delivered on his
return on the 23rd of May 1373 show that he had also visited
Florence on the king&rsquo;s business, and he probably went also to
Padua and there made the acquaintance of Petrarch.</p>

<p>In the second quarter of 1374 Chaucer lived in a whirl of
prosperity. On the 23rd of April the king granted him a pitcher
of wine daily, subsequently commuted for an annuity of 20
marks. From John of Gaunt, who in August 1372 had granted
Philippa Chaucer £10 a year, he himself now received (June 13)
a like annuity in reward for his own and his wife&rsquo;s services.
On the 8th of June he was appointed Comptroller of the Custom
and Subsidy of Wools, Hides and Woodfells and also of the
Petty Customs of Wine in the Port of London. A month before
this appointment, and probably in anticipation of it, he took
(May 10, 1374) a lease for life from the city of London of the
dwelling-house above the gate of Aldgate, and here he lived for
the next twelve years. His own and his wife&rsquo;s income now
amounted to over £60, the equivalent of upwards of £1000 in
modern money. In the next two years large windfalls came to
him in the form of two wardships of Kentish heirs, one of whom
paid him £104, and a grant of £71: 4: 6; the value of some
confiscated wool. In December 1376 he was sent abroad on the
king&rsquo;s service in the retinue of Sir John Burley; in February
1377 he was sent to Paris and Montreuil in connexion probably
with the peace negotiations between England and France, and
at the end of April (after a reward of £20 for his good services)
he was again despatched to France.</p>

<p>On the accession of Richard II. Chaucer was confirmed in his
offices and pensions. In January 1378 he seems to have been
in France in connexion with a proposed marriage between
Richard and the daughter of the French king; and on the 28th
of May of the same year he was sent with Sir Edward de Berkeley
to the lord of Milan and Sir John Hawkwood to treat for help in
the king&rsquo;s wars, returning on the 19th of September. This was
his last diplomatic journey, and the close of a period of his life
generally considered to have been so unprolific of poetry that
little beyond the Clerk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tale of Grisilde,&rdquo; one or two other of
the stories afterwards included in the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, and a
few short poems, are attributed to it, though the poet&rsquo;s actual
absences from England during the eight years amount to little
more than eighteen months. During the next twelve or fifteen
years there is no question that Chaucer was constantly engaged
in literary work, though for the first half of them he had no lack
of official employment. Abundant favour was shown him by the
new king. He was paid £22 as a reward for his later missions in
Edward III.&rsquo;s reign, and was allowed an annual gratuity of 10
marks in addition to his pay of £10 as comptroller of the customs
of wool. In April 1382 a new comptrollership, that of the petty
customs in the Port of London, was given him, and shortly after
he was allowed to exercise it by deputy, a similar licence being
given him in February 1385, at the instance of the earl of Oxford,
as regards the comptrollership of wool. In October 1385 Chaucer
was made a justice of the peace for Kent. In February 1386 we
catch a glimpse of his wife Philippa being admitted to the
fraternity of Lincoln cathedral in the company of Henry, earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
Derby (afterwards Henry IV.), Sir Thomas de Swynford and
other distinguished persons. In August 1386 he was elected one
of the two knights of the shire for Kent, and with this dignity,
though it was one not much appreciated in those days, his good
fortune reached its climax. In December of the same year he
was superseded in both his comptrollerships, almost certainly
as a result of the absence of his patron, John of Gaunt, in Spain,
and the supremacy of the duke of Gloucester. In the following
year the cessation of Philippa&rsquo;s pension suggests that she died
between Midsummer and Michaelmas. In May 1388 Chaucer
surrendered to the king his two pensions of 20 marks each, and
they were re-granted at his request to one John Scalby. The
transaction was unusual and probably points to a pressing need
for ready money, nor for the next fourteen months do we know
of any source of income possessed by Chaucer beyond his annuity
of £10 from John of Gaunt.</p>

<p>In July 1389, after John of Gaunt had returned to England,
and the king had taken the government into his own hands,
Chaucer was appointed clerk of the works at various royal
palaces at a salary of two shillings a day, or over £31 a year,
worth upwards of £500 present value. To this post was subsequently
added the charge of some repairs at St George&rsquo;s Chapel,
Windsor. He was also made a commissioner to maintain the
banks of the Thames between Woolwich and Greenwich, and was
given by the earl of March (grandson of Lionel, duke of Clarence,
his old patron) a sub-forestership at North Petherton, Devon,
obviously a sinecure. While on the king&rsquo;s business, in September
1390, Chaucer was twice robbed by highwaymen, losing £20 of
the king&rsquo;s money. In June 1391 he was superseded in his office
of clerk of the works, and seems to have suffered another spell of
misfortune, of which the first alleviation came in January 1393
when the king made him a present of £10. In February 1394
he was granted a new pension of £20. It is possible, also, that
about this time, or a little later, he was in the service of the earl
of Derby. In 1397 he received from King Richard a grant of a
butt of wine yearly. For this he appears to have asked in terms
that suggest poverty, and in May 1398 he obtained letters of protection
against his creditors, a step perhaps rendered necessary
by an action for debt taken against him earlier in the year.
On the accession of Henry IV. a new pension of 40 marks was
conferred on Chaucer (13th of October 1399) and Richard II.&rsquo;s
grants were formally confirmed. Henry himself, however, was
probably straitened for ready money, and no instalment of the
new pension was paid during the few months of his reign that the
poet lived. Nevertheless, on the strength of his expectations,
on the 24th of December 1399 he leased a tenement in the garden
of St Mary&rsquo;s Chapel, Westminster, and it was probably here that
he died, on the 25th of the following October. He was buried in
Westminster Abbey, and his tomb became the nucleus of what
is now known as Poets&rsquo; Corner.</p>

<p>The portrait of Chaucer, which the affection of his disciple,
Thomas Hoccleve, caused to be painted in a copy of the latter&rsquo;s
<i>Regement of Princes</i> (now Harleian MS. 4866 in the British
Museum), shows him an old man with white hair; he has a
fresh complexion, grey eyes, a straight nose, a grey moustache
and a small double-pointed beard. His dress and hood are black,
and he carries in his hands a string of beads. We may imagine
that it was thus that during the last months of his life he used
to walk about the precincts of the Abbey.</p>

<p>Henry IV.&rsquo;s promise of an additional pension was doubtless
elicited by the <i>Compleynt to his Purs</i>, in the envoy to which
Chaucer addresses him as the &ldquo;conquerour of Brutes
<span class="sidenote">Works.</span>
Albioun.&rdquo; Thus within the last year of his life the
poet was still writing. Nevertheless, as early as 1393-1394, in
lines to his friend Scogan, he had written as if his day for poetry
were past, and it seems probable that his longer poems were
all composed before this date. In the preceding fifteen&mdash;or, if
another view be taken, twenty&mdash;years, his literary activity was
very great, and with the aid of the lists of his works which he gives
in the <i>Legende of Good Women</i> (lines 414-431), and the talk on the
road which precedes the &ldquo;Man of Law&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; (<i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, B. 46-76), the order in which his main works were written
can be traced with approximate certainty,<a name="FnAnchor_1a" id="FnAnchor_1a" href="#Footnote_1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> while a few both of
these and of the minor poems can be connected with definite
dates.</p>

<p>The development of his genius has been attractively summed
up as comprised in three stages, French, Italian and English,
and there is a rough approximation to the truth in this formula,
since his earliest poems are translated from the French or based
on French models, and the two great works of his middle period
are borrowed from the Italian, while his latest stories have no
such obvious and direct originals and in their humour and freedom
anticipate the typically English temper of Henry Fielding.
But Chaucer&rsquo;s indebtedness to French poetry was no passing
phase. For various reasons&mdash;a not very remote French origin
of his own family may be one of them&mdash;he was in no way interested
in older English literature or in the work of his English
contemporaries, save possibly that of &ldquo;the moral Gower.&rdquo; On
the other hand he knew the <i>Roman de la rose</i> as modern English
poets know Shakespeare, and the full extent of his debt to his
French contemporaries, not merely in 1369, but in 1385 and in
1393 (the dates are approximate), is only gradually being discovered.
To be in touch throughout his life with the best French
poets of the day was much for Chaucer. Even with their stimulus
alone he might have developed no small part of his genius. But
it was his great good fortune to add to this continuing French
influence, lessons in plot and construction derived from Boccaccio&rsquo;s
<i>Filostrato</i> and <i>Teseide</i>, as well as some glimpses of the
higher art of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>. He shows acquaintance also
with one of Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnets, and though, when all is said, the
Italian books with which he can be proved to have been intimate
are but few, they sufficed. His study of them was but an
episode in his literary life, but it was an episode of unique importance.
Before it began he had already been making his own
artistic experiments, and it is noteworthy that while he learnt
so much from Boccaccio he improved on his originals as he
translated them. Doubtless his busy life in the service of the
crown had taught him self-confidence, and he uses his Italian
models in his own way and with the most triumphant and assured
success. When he had no more Italian poems to adapt he had
learnt his lesson. The art of weaving a plot out of his own
imagination was never his, but he could take what might be little
more than an anecdote and lend it body and life and colour with
a skill which has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>The most direct example of Chaucer&rsquo;s French studies is his
translation of <i>Le Roman de la rose</i>, a poem written in some
4000 lines by Guillaume Lorris about 1237 and extended to over
22,000 by Jean Clopinel, better known as Jean de Meun, forty
years later. We know from Chaucer himself that he translated
this poem, and the extant English fragment of 7698 lines was
generally assigned to him from 1532, when it was first printed,
till its authorship was challenged in the early years of the Chaucer
Society. The ground of this challenge was its wide divergence
from Chaucer&rsquo;s practice in his undoubtedly genuine works as to
certain niceties of rhyme, notable as to not rhyming words ending
in <i>-y</i> with others ending <i>-ye</i>. It was subsequently discovered,
however, that the whole fragment was divisible linguistically
into three portions, of which the first and second end respectively
at lines 1705 and 5810, and that in the first of these three sections
the variations from Chaucer&rsquo;s accepted practice are insignificant.
Lines 1-1705 have therefore been provisionally accepted as
Chaucer&rsquo;s, and the other two fragments as the work of unknown
translators (James I. of Scotland has been suggested as one of
them), which somehow came to be pieced together. If, however,
the difficulties in the way of this theory are less than those which
confront any other, they are still considerable, and the question
can hardly be treated as closed.</p>

<p>While our knowledge of Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Romaunt of the Rose</i> is
in this unsatisfactory state, another translation of his from
the French, the <i>Book of the Lyon</i> (alluded to in the &ldquo;Retraction&rdquo;
found, in some manuscripts, at the end of the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>), which must certainly have been taken from Guillaume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
Machault&rsquo;s <i>Le Dit du lion</i>, has perished altogether. The strength
of French influence on Chaucer&rsquo;s early work may, however, be
amply illustrated from the first of his poems with which we are
on sure ground, the <i>Book of the Duchesse</i>, or, as it is alternatively
called, the <i>Deth of Blaunche</i>. Here not only are individual
passages closely imitated from Machault and Froissart, but the
dream, the May morning, and the whole machinery of the poem
are taken over from contemporary French conventions. But
even at this stage Chaucer could prove his right to borrow by
the skill with which he makes his materials serve his own purpose,
and some of the lines in the <i>Deth of Blaunche</i> are among the most
tender and charming he ever wrote.</p>

<p>Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>A.B.C.</i>, a poem in honour of the Blessed Virgin, of
which the stanzas begin with the successive letters of the alphabet,
is another early example of French influence. It is taken
from the <i>Pèlerinage de la vie humaine</i>, written by Guillaume de
Deguilleville about 1330. The occurrence of some magnificent
lines in Chaucer&rsquo;s version, combined with evidence that he did
not yet possess the skill to translate at all literally as soon as
rhymes had to be considered, accounts for this poem having been
dated sometimes earlier than the <i>Book of the Duchesse</i>, and
sometimes several years later. With it is usually moved up and
down, though it should surely be placed in the &rsquo;seventies, the
<i>Compleynt to Pity</i>, a fine poem which yet, from its slight obscurity
and absence of Chaucer&rsquo;s usual ease, may very well some day
prove to be a translation from the French.</p>

<p>While Chaucer thus sought to reproduce both the matter
and the style of French poetry in England, he found other
materials in popular Latin books. Among his lost works are
renderings of &ldquo;Origenes upon the Maudeleyne,&rdquo; and of Pope
Innocent III. on &ldquo;The Wreced Engendring of Mankinde&rdquo;
(<i>De miseria conditionis humanae</i>). He must have begun his
attempts at straightforward narrative with the <i>Lyf of Seynt
Cecyle</i> (the weakest of all his works, the second Nun&rsquo;s Tale in
the Canterbury series) from the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> of Jacobus de
Voragine, and the story of the patience of Grisilde, taken from
Petrarch&rsquo;s Latin version of a tale by Boccaccio. In both of these
he condenses a little, but ventures on very few changes, though
he lets his readers see his impatience with his originals. In his
story of Constance (afterwards ascribed to the Man of Law),
taken from the Anglo-Norman chronicle of Nicholas Trivet,
written about 1334, we find him struggling to put some substance
into another weak tale, but still without the courage to remedy
its radical faults, though here, as with Grisilde, he does as much
for his heroine as the conventional exaltation of one virtue at
a time permitted. It is possible that other tales which now stand
in the Canterbury series were written originally at this period.
What is certain is that at some time in the &rsquo;seventies three or four
Italian poems passed into Chaucer&rsquo;s possession, and that he set
to work busily to make use of them. One of the most interesting
of the poems reclaimed for him by Professor Skeat is a fragmentary
&ldquo;Compleynt,&rdquo; part of which is written in <i>terza rima</i>. While
he thus experimented with the metre of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
he made his first attempt to use the material provided by
Boccaccio&rsquo;s <i>Teseide</i> in another fragment of great interest, that of
<i>Quene Anelida and Fals Arcyte</i>. More than a third of this is
taken up with another, and quite successful, metrical experiment
in Anelida&rsquo;s &ldquo;compleynt,&rdquo; but in the introduction of Anelida
herself Chaucer made the first of his three unsuccessful efforts
to construct a plot for an important poem out of his own head,
and the fragment which begins so well breaks off abruptly at
line 357.</p>

<p>For a time the <i>Teseide</i> seems to have been laid aside, and it
was perhaps at this moment, in despondency at his failure, that
Chaucer wrote his most important prose work, the translation of
the <i>De Consolatione Philosophiae</i> of Boethius. Reminiscences
of this helped to enrich many of his subsequent poems, and
inspired five of his shorter pieces (<i>The Former Age, Fortune,
Truth, Gentilesse</i> and <i>Lak of Stedfastnesse</i>), but the translation
itself was only a partial success. To borrow his own phrase, his
&ldquo;Englysh was insufficient&rdquo; to reproduce such difficult Latin.
The translation is often barely intelligible without the original,
and it is only here and there that it flows with any ease or
rhythm.</p>

<p>If Chaucer felt this himself he must have been speedily consold
by achieving in <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> his greatest artistic
triumph. Warned by his failure in <i>Anelida and Arcyte</i>, he was
content this time to take his plot unaltered from the <i>Filostrato</i>,
and to follow Boccaccio step by step through the poem. But
he did not follow him as a mere translator. He had done his
duty manfully for the saints &ldquo;of other holinesse&rdquo; in Cecyle,
Grisilde and Constance, whom he was forbidden by the rules of
the game to clothe with complete flesh and blood. In this great
love-story there were no such restrictions, and the characters
which Boccaccio&rsquo;s treatment left thin and conventional became
in Chaucer&rsquo;s hands convincingly human. No other English poem
is so instinct with the glory and tragedy of youth, and in the
details of the story Chaucer&rsquo;s gifts of vivid colouring, of humour
and pity, are all at their highest.</p>

<p>An unfortunate theory that the reference in the <i>Legends of
Good Women</i> to &ldquo;al the love of Palamon and Arcyte&rdquo; is to a
hypothetical poem in seven-line stanzas on this theme, which
Chaucer is imagined, when he came to plan the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,
to have suppressed in favour of a new version in heroic couplets,
has obscured the close connexion in temper and power between
what we know as the &ldquo;Knight&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; and the <i>Troilus</i>. The
poem may have been more or less extensively revised before, with
admirable fitness, it was assigned to the Knight, but that its
main composition can be separated by several years from that of
<i>Troilus</i> is aesthetically incredible. Chaucer&rsquo;s art here again is at
its highest. He takes the plot of Boccaccio&rsquo;s <i>Teseide</i>, but only
as much of it as he wants, and what he takes he heightens and
humanizes with the same skill which he had shown in transforming
the <i>Filostrato</i>. Of the individual characters Theseus
himself, the arbiter of the plot, is most notably developed;
Emilie and her two lovers receive just as much individuality as
they will bear without disturbing the atmosphere of romance.
The whole story is pulled together and made more rapid and
effective. A comparison of almost any scene as told by the two
poets suffices to show Chaucer&rsquo;s immense superiority. At some
subsequent period the &ldquo;Squire&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; of Cambuscan, the fair
Canacee and the Horse of Brass, was gallantly begun in something
of the same key, but Chaucer took for it more materials
than he could use, and for lack of the help of a leader like Boccaccio
he was obliged to leave the story, in Milton&rsquo;s phrase,
&ldquo;half-told,&rdquo; though the fragment written certainly takes us
very much less than half-way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in connexion (as is reasonably believed) with the
betrothal or marriage of Anne of Bohemia to Richard II. (i.e.
about 1381-1382), Chaucer had brought to a successful completion
the <i>Parlement of Foules</i>, a charming sketch of 699 lines,
in which the other birds, on Saint Valentine&rsquo;s day, counsel the
&ldquo;Formel Egle&rdquo; on her choice of a mate. His success here, as in
the case of the <i>Deth of Blaunche the Duchesse</i>, was due to the
absence of any need for a climax; and though the materials
which he borrowed were mainly Latin (with some help from
passages of the <i>Teseide</i> not fully needed for <i>Palamon and Arcyte</i>)
his method of handling them would have been quite approved
by his friends among the French poets. A more ambitious
venture, the <i>Hous of Fame</i>, in which Chaucer imagines himself
borne aloft by an eagle to Fame&rsquo;s temple, describes what he
sees and hears there, and then breaks off in apparent inability
to get home, shows a curious mixture of the poetic ideals of the
<i>Roman de la rose</i> and reminiscences of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>.</p>

<p>As the <i>Hous of Fame</i> is most often remembered and quoted
for the personal touches and humour of Chaucer&rsquo;s conversation
with the eagle, so the most-quoted passages in the Prologue to
the <i>Legende of Good Women</i> are those in which Chaucer professes
his affection for the daisy, and the attack on his loyalty by
Cupid and its defence by Alceste. Recent discoveries have
shown, however, that (besides obligations to Machault) some of
the touches about the daisy and the controversy between the
partisans of the Flower and of the Leaf are snatches from poems
by his friends Froissart and Deschamps, which Chaucer takes up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
and returns to them with pretty compliments, and that he was
indebted to Froissart for some of the framework of his poem.<a name="FnAnchor_2a" id="FnAnchor_2a" href="#Footnote_2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
Both of the two versions of the Prologue to the <i>Legende</i> are
charming, and some of the tales, notably that of Cleopatra,
rank with Chaucer&rsquo;s best work. When, however, he had written
eight and part of the ninth he tired of his scheme, which was
planned to celebrate nineteen of Cupid&rsquo;s faithful &ldquo;saints,&rdquo; with
Alcestis as their queen. With his usual hopefulness he had
overlooked the risk of monotony, which obviously weighed
heavily on him ere he broke off, and the loss of the other ten
stories is less to be regretted than that of the celebration of
Alceste, and a possible epilogue which might have exceeded in
charm the Prologue itself.</p>

<p>Chaucer&rsquo;s failure to complete the scheme of the <i>Legende of
Good Women</i> may have been partly due to the attractions of the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, which were probably taken up in
<span class="sidenote">Canterbury Tales.</span>
immediate succession to it. His guardianship of two
Kentish wards, his justiceship of the peace, his representing
the county in the parliament of 1386, his
commissionership of the river-bank between Greenwich and
Woolwich, all make it easy to understand his dramatic use of the
merry crowds he saw on the Canterbury road, without supposing
him to have had recourse to Boccaccio&rsquo;s <i>Decamerone</i>, a book
which there is no proof of his having seen. The pilgrims whom
he imagines to have assembled at the Tabard Inn in Southwark,
where Harry Bailey was host, are said to have numbered &ldquo;wel
nyne and twenty in a company,&rdquo; and the Prologue gives full-length
sketches of a Knight, a Squire (his son), and their
Yeoman; of a Prioress, Monk, Friar, Oxford Clerk, and Parson,
with two disreputable hangers-on of the church, a Summoner
and Pardoner; of a Serjeant-at-Law and a Doctor of Physic,
and of a Franklin, or country gentleman, Merchant, Shipman,
Miller, Cook, Manciple, Reeve, Ploughman (the Parson&rsquo;s brother)
and the ever-famous Wife of Bath. Five London burgesses are
described in a group, and a Nun and Priest<a name="FnAnchor_3a" id="FnAnchor_3a" href="#Footnote_3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> are mentioned as
in attendance on the Prioress. Each of these, with Chaucer
himself making the twenty-ninth, was pledged to tell two tales,
but including one second attempt and a tale told by the Yeoman
of a Canon, who overtakes the pilgrims on the road, we have
only twenty finished stories, two unfinished and two interrupted
ones. As in the case of the <i>Legende of Good Women</i>, our loss is
not so much that of the additional stories as of the completed
framework. The wonderful character sketches of the Prologue
are carried yet farther by the Talks on the Road which link the
different tales, and two of these Talks, in which the Wife of
Bath and the Pardoner respectively edify the company, have the
importance of separate Tales, but between the Tales that have
come down to us there are seven links missing,<a name="FnAnchor_4a" id="FnAnchor_4a" href="#Footnote_4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and it was left
to a later and weaker hand to narrate, in the &ldquo;Tale of Beryn,&rdquo;
the adventures of the pilgrims at Canterbury.</p>

<p>The reference to the <i>Lyf of Seynt Cecyle</i> in the Prologue to
the <i>Legende of Good Women</i> gives external proof that Chaucer
included earlier work in the scheme of the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,
and mention has been made of other stories which are indisputably
early. In the absence of any such metrical tests as have
proved useful in the case of Shakespeare, the dates at which
several of the Tales were composed remain doubtful, while in
the case of at least two, the Clerk&rsquo;s tale of Grisilde and the
Monk&rsquo;s tragedies, there is evidence of early work being revised
and supplemented. It is fortunately impossible to separate the
prologue to the charmingly told story of &ldquo;yonge Hugh of
Lincoln&rdquo; from the tale itself, and with the &ldquo;quod sche&rdquo; in the
second line as proof that Chaucer was here writing specially for
his Prioress we are forbidden to limit the new stories to any one
metre or tone. There can be no doubt, however, that what may
be called the Tales of the Churls (Miller, Reeve, Summoner,
Friar, &amp;c.), and the conversational outpourings of the Pardoner
and Wife of Bath, form, with the immortal Prologue, the most
important and distinctive additions to the older work. In these,
and in the Pardoner&rsquo;s story of Death and the Three Revellers,
and the Nun&rsquo;s Priest&rsquo;s masterly handling of the fable of the
Cock and Fox, both of them free from the grossness which marks
the others, Chaucer takes stories which could have been told
in a short page of prose and elaborates them with all the skill
in narration which he had sedulously cultivated. The conjugal
reminiscences of the Wife of Bath and the Reeve&rsquo;s Tale with its
abominable climax (lightened a little by Aleyn&rsquo;s farewell, lines
316-319) are among the great things in Chaucer, as surely as
<i>Troilus</i>, and <i>Palamon and Arcyte</i> and the <i>Prologue</i>. They help
notably to give him the width of range which may certainly be
claimed for him.</p>

<p>In or soon after 1391 Chaucer wrote in prose for an eleven-year-old
reader, whom he addresses as &ldquo;Litel Lowis my son,&rdquo;
a treatise on the use of the Astrolabe, its short prologue being
the prettiest specimen of his prose. The wearisome tale of
&ldquo;Melibee and his wyf Prudence,&rdquo; which was perhaps as much
admired in English as it had been in Latin and French, may have
been translated at any time. The sermon on Penitence, used as
the Parson&rsquo;s Tale, was probably the work of his old age. &ldquo;Envoys&rdquo;
to his friends Scogan and Bukton, a translation of some
balades by Sir Otes de Granson, and the <i>Compleynt to his Purs</i>
complete the record of his minor poetry. We have his own
statement that in his youth he had written many Balades,
Roundels and Virelayes in honour of Love, and the two songs
embedded respectively in the <i>Parlement of Foules</i> and the Prologue
to the <i>Legende of Good Women</i> are charming and musical.
His extant shorter poems, however, whether early or late,
offer no excuse for claiming high rank for him as a lyrist. He
had very little sheer singing power, and though there are fine
lines in his short poems, witness the famous &ldquo;Flee fro the prees
and dwell with soothfastnesse,&rdquo; they lack the sustained concentration
of great work. From the drama, again, Chaucer was cut
off, and it is idle to argue from the innumerable dramatic touches
in his poems and his gift of characterization as to what he
might have done had he lived two centuries later. His own age
delighted in stories, and he gave it the stories it demanded
invested with a humanity, a grace and strength which place him
among the world&rsquo;s greatest narrative poets, and which bring the
England of his own day, with all the colour and warmth of life,
wonderfully near to all his readers.</p>

<p>The part played by Chaucer in the development of the English
language has often been overrated. He neither corrupted it, as
used to be said, by introducing French words which
<span class="sidenote">Influence.</span>
it would otherwise have avoided, nor bore any such
part in fixing it as was afterwards played by the translators
of the Bible. When he was growing up educated society
in England was still bilingual, and the changes in vocabulary
and pronunciation which took place during his life were the
natural results of a society, which had been bilingual with a
bias towards French, giving an exclusive preference to English.
The practical identity of Chaucer&rsquo;s language with that of Gower
shows that both merely used the best English of their day with
the care and slightly conservative tendency which befitted poets.
Chaucer&rsquo;s service to the English language lies in his decisive
success having made it impossible for any later English poet to
attain fame, as Gower had done, by writing alternatively in
Latin and French. The claim which should be made for him is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
that, at least as regards poetry, he proved that English was
&ldquo;sufficient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chaucer borrowed both his stanza forms and his &ldquo;decasyllabic&rdquo;
couplets (mostly with an extra syllable at the end
of the line) from Guillaume Machault, and his music, like that
of his French master and his successors, depends very largely
on assigning to every syllable its full value, and more especially
on the due pronunciation of the final -<i>e</i>. The slower movement
of change in Scotland allowed time for Chaucer to exercise a
potent influence on Scottish poetry, but in England this final
-<i>e</i>, to which most of the earlier grammatical forms by Chaucer&rsquo;s
time had been reduced, itself fell rapidly into disuse during the
15th century, and a serious barrier was thus raised to the appreciation
of the artistic value of his verse. His disciples, Hoccleve
and Lydgate, who at first had caught some echoes of his rhythms,
gradually yielded to the change in pronunciation, so that there
was no living tradition to hand down his secret, while successive
copyists reduced his text to a state in which it was only by
accident that lines could be scanned correctly. For fully three
centuries his reputation was sustained solely by his narrative
power, his warmest panegyrists betraying no consciousness
that they were praising one of the greatest technical masters
of poetry. Even when thus maimed, however, his works found
readers and lovers in every generation, and every improvement
in his text has set his fame on a surer basis.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The <i>Canterbury Tales</i> have always been Chaucer&rsquo;s
most popular work, and, including fragments, upwards of sixty
15th-century manuscripts of it still survive. Two thin volumes of
his minor poems were among the little quartos which Caxton printed
by way of advertisement immediately on his return to England;
the <i>Canterbury Tales</i> and <i>Boethius</i> followed in 1478, <i>Troilus</i> and a
second edition of the <i>Tales</i> in 1483, the <i>Hous of Fame</i> in 1484. The
<i>Canterbury Tales</i> were subsequently printed in 1492 (Pynson), 1498
(de Worde) and 1526 (Pynson); <i>Troilus</i> in 1517 (de Worde) and
1526 (Pynson); the <i>Hous of Fame</i> in 1526 (Pynson); the <i>Parlement
of Foules</i> in 1526 (Pynson) and 1530 (de Worde), and the <i>Mars</i>,
&ldquo;<i>Venus</i>&rdquo; and <i>Envoy to Bukton</i> by Julyan Notary about 1500.
Pynson&rsquo;s three issues in 1526 almost amounted to a collected edition,
but the first to which the title <i>The Workes of Geffray Chaucer</i> was
given was that edited by William Thynne in 1532 for Thomas
Godfray. Of this there was a new edition in 1542 for John Reynes
and William Bonham, and an undated reprint a few years later for
Bonham, Kele, Petit and Toye, each of whom put his name on part
of the edition. In 1561 a reprint, with numerous additions, edited
by John Stowe, was printed by J. Kyngston for J. Wight, and this
was re-edited, with fresh additions by Thomas Speght, in 1598 for
G. Bishop and again in 1602 for Adam Islip. In 1687 there was an
anonymous reprint, and in 1721 John Urry produced the last and
worst of the folios. By this time the paraphrasers were already at
work, Dryden rewriting the tales of the Knight, the Nun&rsquo;s Priest
and the Wife of Bath, and Pope the Merchant&rsquo;s. In 1737 (reprinted
in 1740) the Prologue and Knight&rsquo;s Tale were edited (anonymously)
by Thomas Morell &ldquo;from the most authentic manuscripts,&rdquo; and
here, though by dint of much violence and with many mistakes,
Chaucer&rsquo;s lines were for the first time in print given in a form in
which they could be scanned. This promise of better things (Morell
still thought it necessary to accompany his text with the paraphrases
by Betterton and Dryden) was fulfilled by a fine edition of the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i> (1775-1778), in which Thomas Tyrwhitt&rsquo;s scholarly
instincts produced a comparatively good text from second-rate
manuscripts and accompanied it with valuable illustrative notes.
The next edition of any importance was that edited by Thomas
Wright for the Percy Society in 1848-1851, based on the erratic
but valuable British Museum manuscript Harley 7334, containing
readings which must be either Chaucer&rsquo;s second thoughts or the
emendations of a brilliantly clever scribe. In 1866 Richard Morris
re-edited this text in a more scholarly manner for the Aldine edition
of the British Poets, and in the following year produced for the
Clarendon Press Series a school edition of the Prologue and Tales
of the Knight and Nun&rsquo;s Priest, edited with the fulness and care
previously bestowed only on Greek and Latin classics.</p>

<p>In 1868 the foundation of the Chaucer Society, with Dr Furnivall
as its director and chief worker, and Henry Bradshaw as a leading
spirit, led to the publication of a six-text edition of the <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, and the consequent discovery that a manuscript belonging
to the Earl of Ellesmere, though undoubtedly &ldquo;edited,&rdquo; contained
the best available text. The Chaucer Society also printed the best
manuscripts of <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> and of all the minor poems,
and thus cleared the way for the &ldquo;Oxford&rdquo; Chaucer, edited by
Professor Skeat, with a wealth of annotation, for the Clarendon Press
in 1894, the text of which was used for the splendid folio printed
two years later by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press, with
illustrations by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. A supplementary volume
of the Oxford edition, entitled <i>Chaucerian and other Pieces</i>, issued
by Professor Skeat in 1897, contains the prose and verse which his
early publishers and editors, from Pynson and Thynne onwards,
included among his Works by way of illustration, but which had
gradually come to be regarded as forming part of his text. The
reasons for their rejection are fully stated by Professor Skeat in the
work named and also in <i>The Chaucer Canon</i> (1900). Many of these
pieces have now been traced to other authors, and their exclusion
has helped to clear not only Chaucer&rsquo;s text but also his biography,
which used (as in the &ldquo;Life&rdquo; published by William Godwin in two
quarto volumes in 1803) to be encumbered with inferences from
works now known not to be Chaucer&rsquo;s, notably the <i>Testament of
Love</i> written by Thomas Usk. All information about Chaucer&rsquo;s
life available in 1900 will be found summarized by Mr R.E.G.
Kirk in <i>Life-Records of Chaucer</i>, part iv., published by the Chaucer
Society in that year. See also <i>Chaucer; a Bibliographical Manual</i>,

1558. It is celebrated for its hot mineral springs, which vary
in temperature from 135° to 177° Fahr., and at their maximum
rank as the hottest in France. The water, which contains
bicarbonate of soda, is employed not only medicinally (for
rheumatism, &amp;c.), but also for the washing of fleeces, the incubation
of eggs, and various other economic purposes; and it
furnishes a ready means of heating the houses of the town during
winter. In the immediate neighbourhood is the cold chalybeate
spring of Condamine. The warm springs were known to the
Romans, and are mentioned by Sidonius Apollinaris.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAULIEU, GUILLAUME AMFRYE DE<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> (1639-1720), French
poet and wit, was born at Fontenay, Normandy, in 1639. His
father, <i>maître des comptes</i> of Rouen, sent him to study at the
Collège de Navarre. Guillaume early showed the wit that was
to distinguish him, and gained the favour of the duke of Vendôme,
who procured for him the abbey of Aumale and other benefices.
Louis Joseph, duke of Vendôme, and his brother Philippe, grand
prior of the Knights of Malta in France, at that time had a joint
establishment at the Temple, where they gathered round them
a very gay and reckless circle. Chaulieu became the constant
companion and adviser of the two princes. He made an expedition
to Poland in the suite of the marquis de Béthune, hoping to
make a career for himself in the court of John Sobieski; he saw
one of the Polish king&rsquo;s campaigns in Ukraine, but returned to
Paris without securing any advancement. Saint-Simon says that
the abbé helped his patron the grand prior to rob the duke of
Vendôme, and that the king sent orders that the princes should
take the management of their affairs from him. This account
has been questioned by Sainte-Beuve, who regards Saint-Simon
as a prejudiced witness. In his later years Chaulieu spent much
time at the little court of the duchesse du Maine at Sceaux.
There he became the trusted and devoted friend of Mdlle
Delaunay, with whom he carried on an interesting correspondence.
Among his poems the best known are &ldquo;Fontenay&rdquo; and
&ldquo;La Retraite.&rdquo; Chaulieu died on the 27th of June 1720.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUMETTE, PIERRE GASPARD<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> (1763-1794), French
revolutionist, was born at Nevers. Until the Revolution he
lived a somewhat wandering life, interesting himself particularly
in botany. He was a student of medicine at Paris in 1790,
became one of the orators of the club of the Cordeliers, and
contributed anonymously to the <i>Révolutions de Paris</i>. As
member of the insurrectionary Commune of the 10th of August
1792, he was delegated to visit the prisons, with full power to
arrest suspects. He was accused later of having taken part in
the massacres of September, but was able to prove that at that
time he had been sent by the provisional executive council to
Normandy to oversee a requisition of 60,000 men. Returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
from this mission, he pronounced an eloquent discourse in favour
of the republic. His simple manners, easy speech, ardent
temperament and irreproachable private life gave him great
influence in Paris, and he was elected president of the Commune,
defending the municipality in that capacity at the bar of the
Convention on the 31st of October 1792. Re-elected in the
municipal elections of the 2nd of December 1792, he was soon
charged with the functions of procurator of the Commune, and
contributed with success to the enrolments of volunteers by his
appeals to the populace. Chaumette was one of the ringleaders
in the attacks of the 31st of May and of the 2nd of June 1793
on the Girondists, toward whom he showed himself relentless.
He demanded the formation of a revolutionary army, and
preached the extermination of all traitors. He was one of the
promoters of the worship of Reason, and on the 10th of November
1793 he presented the goddess to the Convention in the guise of
an actress. On the 23rd of the same month he obtained a decree
closing all the churches of Paris, and placing the priests under
strict surveillance; but on the 25th he retraced his steps and
obtained from the Commune the free exercise of worship. He
wished to save the Hébertists by a new insurrection and struggled
against Robespierre; but a revolutionary decree promulgated
by the Commune on his demand was overthrown by the Convention.
Robespierre had him accused with the Hébertists; he
was arrested, imprisoned in the Luxembourg, condemned by the
Revolutionary tribunal and executed on the 13th of April 1794.
Chaumette&rsquo;s career had its brighter side. He was an ardent
social reformer; he secured the abolition of corporal punishment
in the schools, the suppression of lotteries, of houses of ill-fame
and of obscene literature; he instituted reforms in the hospitals,
and insisted on the honours of public burial for the poor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUMONT-EN-BASSIGNY<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span>, a town of eastern France,
capital of the department of Haute-Marne, a railway junction
163 m. E.S.E. of Paris on the main line of the Eastern railway
to Belfort. Pop. (1906) 12,089. Chaumont is picturesquely
situated on an eminence between the rivers Marne and Suize
in the angle formed by their confluence. To the west a lofty
viaduct over the Suize carries the railway. The church of
St-Jean-Baptiste dates from the 13th century, the choir and
lateral chapels belonging to the 15th and 16th. In the interior
the sculptured triforium (15th century), the spiral staircase in
the transept and a Holy Sepulchre are of interest. The lycée
and the hospital have chapels of the 17th and 16th centuries
respectively. The Tour Hautefeuille (a keep of the 11th century)
is the principal relic of a château of the counts of Champagne;
the rest of the site is occupied by the law courts. In the Place
de l&rsquo;Escargot stands a statue of the chemist Philippe Lebon
(1767-1804), born in Haute-Marne. Chaumont is the seat of
a prefect and of a court of assizes, and has tribunals of first
instance and of commerce, a lycée, training colleges, and a
branch of the Bank of France. The main industries are glove-making
and leather-dressing. The town has trade in grain, iron,
mined in the vicinity, and leather. In 1190 it received a charter
from the counts of Champagne. It was here that in 1814 Great
Britain, Austria, Russia and Prussia concluded the treaty (dated
March 1, signed March 9) by which they severally bound themselves
not to conclude a separate peace with Napoleon, and to
continue the war until France should have been reduced within
the boundaries of 1792.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUNCEY, ISAAC<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1772-1840), American naval commander,
was born at Black Rock, Connecticut, on the 20th of
February 1772. He was brought up in the merchant service, and
entered the United States navy as a lieutenant in 1798. His first
services were rendered against the Barbary pirates. During these
operations, more especially at Tripoli, he greatly distinguished
himself, and was voted by Congress a sword of honour, which,
however, does not appear to have been given him. The most
active period of his life is that of his command on the Lakes during
the War of 1812. He took the command at Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor on
Lake Ontario in October 1812. There was at that time only one
American vessel, the brig &ldquo;Oneida&rdquo; (16), and one armed prize,
a schooner, on the lake. But Commodore Chauncey brought
from 400 to 500 officers and men with him, and local resources
for building being abundant, he had by November formed a
squadron of ten vessels, with which he attacked the Canadian
port, York, taking it in April 1813, capturing one vessel and
causing the destruction of another then building. He returned
to Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor. In May Sir James Lucas Yeo (1732-1818)
came out from England with some 500 officers and men, to
organize a squadron for service on the Lakes. By the end of
the month he was ready for service with a squadron of eight
ships and brigs, and some small craft. The governor, Sir G.
Prevost, gave him no serious support. On the 29th of May, during
Chauncey&rsquo;s absence at Niagara, the Americans were attacked
at Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor and would have been defeated if Prevost had
not insisted on a retreat at the very moment when the American
shipbuilding yard was in danger of being burnt, with a ship of more
than eight hundred tons on the stocks. The retreat of the British
force gave Chauncey time to complete this vessel, the &ldquo;General
Pike,&rdquo; which was so far superior to anything under Yeo&rsquo;s command
that she was said to be equal in effective strength to
the whole of the British flotilla. The American commodore was
considered by many of his subordinates to have displayed
excessive caution. In August he skirmished with Sir James Yeo&rsquo;s
small squadron of six vessels, but made little effective use of
his own fourteen. Two of his schooners were upset in a squall,
with the loss of all hands, and he allowed two to be cut off by
Yeo. Commodore Chauncey showed a preference for relying on
his long guns, and a disinclination to come to close quarters.
He was described as chasing the British squadron all round the
lake, but his encounters did not go beyond artillery duels at
long range, and he allowed his enemy to continue in existence
long after he might have been destroyed. The winter suspended
operations, and both sides made exertions to increase their forces.
The Americans had the advantage of commanding greater
resources for shipbuilding. Sir James Yeo began by blockading
Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor in the early part of 1814, but when the American
squadron was ready he was compelled to retire by the disparity
of the forces. The American commodore was now able to
blockade the British flotilla at Kingston. When the cruising
season of the lake was nearly over he in his turn retired to
Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor, and did not leave it for the rest of the war.
During his later years he served as commissioner of the navy,
and was president of the board of naval commissioners from
1833 till his death at Washington on the 27th of February 1840.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUNCY, CHARLES<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (1592-1672), president of Harvard
College, was born at Yardley-Bury, Hertfordshire, England, in
November 1592, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge,
of which he became a fellow. He was in turn vicar at Ware,
Hertfordshire (1627-1633), and at Marston St Lawrence, Northamptonshire
(1633-1637). Refusing to observe the ecclesiastical
regulations of Archbishop Laud, he was brought before the court
of high commission in 1629, and again in 1634, when, for opposing
the placing of a rail around the communion table, he was suspended
and imprisoned. His formal recantation in February
1637 caused him lasting self-reproach and humiliation. In 1637
he emigrated to America, and from 1638 until 1641 was an
associate pastor at Plymouth, where, however, his advocacy of
the baptism of infants by immersion caused dissatisfaction.
He was the pastor at Scituate, Massachusetts, from 1641 until
1654, and from 1654 until his death was president of Harvard
College, as the successor of the first president Henry Dunster
(c. 1612-1659). He died on the 19th of February 1672. By
his sermons and his writings he exerted a great influence in
colonial Massachusetts, and according to Mather was &ldquo;a most
incomparable scholar.&rdquo; His writings include: <i>The Plain
Doctrine of the Justification of a Sinner in the Sight of God</i> (1659)

<p>President Chauncy&rsquo;s great-grandson, CHARLES CHAUNCY
(1705-1787), a prominent American theologian, was born in
Boston, Massachusetts, on the 1st of January 1705, and graduated
at Harvard in 1721. In 1727 he was chosen as the colleague
of Thomas Foxcroft (1697-1769) in the pastorate of the First
Church of Boston, continuing as pastor of this church until his
death. At the time of the &ldquo;Great Awakening&rdquo; of 1740-1743 and
afterwards, Chauncy was the leader of the so-called &ldquo;Old Light&rdquo;
party in New England, which strongly condemned the Whitefieldian
revival as an outbreak of emotional extravagance. His
views were ably presented in his sermon <i>Enthusiasm</i> and in his
<i>Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in New England</i>
(1743), written in answer to Jonathan Edwards&rsquo;s <i>Some Thoughts
Concerning the Present Revival of Religion in New England</i> (1742).
He also took a leading part in opposition to the projected establishment
of an Anglican Episcopate in America, and before and
during the American War of Independence he ardently supported
the whig or patriot party. Theologically he has been
classed as a precursor of the New England Unitarians. He died
in Boston on the 10th of February 1787. His publications include:
<i>Compleat View of Episcopacy, as Exhibited in the Fathers
of the Christian Church, until the close of the Second Century</i> (1771);
<i>Salvation of All Men, Illustrated and Vindicated as a Scripture
Doctrine</i> (1782); <i>The Mystery Hid from Ages and Generations

3515;</b> of the village (1908) about 750. The lake is a beautiful
body of water over 1300 ft. above sea-level, 20 m. long, and
from a few hundred yards to 3 m. in width. The town of Chautauqua
is situated near the north end and is within easy reach
by steamboat and electric car connexions with the main railways
between the east and the west. The town is known almost solely
as being the permanent home of the Chautauqua Institution, a
system of popular education founded in 1874 by Lewis Miller
(1829-1899) of Akron, Ohio, and Bishop John H. Vincent
(b. 1832). The village, covering about three hundred acres of
land, is carefully laid out to provide for the work of the
Institution.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua Institution began as a Sunday-School
Normal Institute, and for nearly a quarter of a century the
administration was in the hands of Mr Miller, who was responsible
for the business management, and Bishop Vincent, who was
head of the instruction department. Though founded by
Methodists, in its earliest years it became non-sectarian and has
furnished a meeting-ground for members of all sects and denominations.
At the very outset the activities of the assembly
were twofold: (1) the conducting of a summer school for
Sunday-school teachers, and (2) the presentation of a series of
correlated lectures and entertainments. Although the movement
was and still is primarily religious, it has always been
assumed that the best religious education must necessarily take
advantage of the best that the educational world can afford in
the literatures, arts and sciences. The scope of the plan rapidly
broadened, and in 1879 a regular group of schools with graded
courses of study was established. At about the same time, also,
the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, providing a
continuous home-reading system, was founded. The season
lasts during June, July and August. In 1907 some 325 lectures,
concerts, readings and entertainments were presented by a
group of over 190 lecturers, readers and musicians, while at the
same time 200 courses in the summer schools were offered by a
faculty of instructors drawn from the leading colleges and
normal schools of the country.</p>

<p>The Chautauqua movement has had an immense influence on
education in the United States, an influence which is especially
marked in three directions: (1) in the establishment of about
300 local assemblies or &ldquo;Chautauquas&rdquo; in the United States
patterned after the mother Chautauqua; (2) in the promotion
of the idea of summer education, which has been followed by
the founding of summer schools or sessions at a large number
of American universities, and of various special summer schools,
such as the Catholic Summer School of America, with headquarters
at Cliff Haven, Clinton county, New York, and the
Jewish Chautauqua Society, with headquarters at Buffalo, N.Y.;
and (3) in the establishment of numerous correspondence schools
patterned in a general way after the system provided by the
Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUVIGNY<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span>, a town of western France, in the department
of Vienne, 20 m. E. of Poitiers by rail. Pop. (1906) 2326. The
town is finely situated overlooking the Vienne and a small
torrent, and has two interesting Romanesque churches, both
restored in modern times. There are also ruins of a château of
the bishops of Poitiers, and of other strongholds. Near Chauvigny
is the curious bone-cavern of Jioux, the entrance to which
is fortified by large blocks of stone. The town carries on lime-burning
and plaster-manufacture, and there are stone quarries
in the vicinity. Trade is in wool and feathers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUVIN, ÉTIENNE<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (1640-1725), French Protestant divine,
was born at Nîmes on the 18th of April 1640. At the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes he retired to Rotterdam, where he was for
some years preacher at the Walloon church; in 1695 the elector
of Brandenburg appointed him pastor and professor of philosophy,
and later inspector of the French college at Berlin, where
he enjoyed considerable reputation as a representative of
Cartesianism and as a student of physics. His principal work
is a laborious <i>Lexicon Rationale, sive Thesaurus Philosophicus</i>
(Rotterdam, 1692; new and enlarged edition, Leuwarden, 1713).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
He also wrote <i>Theses de Cognitione Dei</i> (1662), and started the
<i>Nouveau Journal des Savans</i> (1694-1698).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAUVINISM<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span>, a term for unreasonable and exaggerated
patriotism, the French equivalent of &ldquo;Jingoism.&rdquo; The word
originally signified idolatry of Napoleon, being taken from a
much-wounded veteran, Nicholas Chauvin, who, by his adoration
of the emperor, became the type of blind enthusiasm for national
military glory.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CHAUX DE FONDS, LA<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span>, a large industrial town in the Swiss
canton of Neuchâtel. It is about 19 m. by rail N. W. of Neuchâtel,
and stands at a height of about 3255 ft. in a valley (5 m. long)
of the same name in the Jura. Pop. (1900) 35,968 (only 13,659
in 1850); (1905) 38,700, mainly French-speaking and
Protestants; of the 6114 &ldquo;Catholics&rdquo; the majority are &ldquo;Old
Catholics.&rdquo; It is a centre of the watch-making industry,
especially of gold watch cases; about 70% of those manufactured
in Switzerland are turned out here. In 1900 it exported watches
to the value of nearly £3,000,000 sterling. There is a school of
industrial art (engraving and enamelling watch cases) and a
school of watch-making (including instruction in the manufacture
of chronometers and other scientific instruments of precision).
It boasts of being <i>le plus gros village de l&rsquo;Europe</i>, and certainly
has preserved some of the features of a big village. Léopold
Robert (1794-1835), the painter, was born here.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAVES<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span>, a town of northern Portugal, in the district of Villa
Real, formerly included in the province of Traz os Montes;
8 m. S. of the Spanish frontier, on the right bank of the river
Tamega. Pop. (1900) 6388. Chaves is the ancient <i>Aquae
Flaviae</i>, famous for its hot saline springs, which are still in use.
A fine Roman bridge of 18 arches spans the Tamega. In the 16th
century Chaves contained 20,000 inhabitants; it was long one of
the principal frontier fortresses, and in fact derives its present
name from the position which makes it the &ldquo;keys,&rdquo; or <i>chaves</i>, of
the north. One of its churches contains the tomb of Alphonso I.
of Portugal (1139-1185). In 1830 the town gave the title of
marquess to Pinto da Fonseca, a leader of the Miguelite party.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHAZELLES, JEAN MATHIEU DE<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1657-1710), French
hydrographer, was born at Lyons on the 24th of July 1657.
He was nominated professor of hydrography at Marseilles in
1685, and in that capacity carried out various coast surveys. In
1693 he was engaged to publish a second volume of the <i>Neptune
français</i>, which was to include the hydrography of the
Mediterranean. For this purpose he visited the Levant and Egypt.
When in Egypt he measured the pyramids, and, finding that
the angles formed by the sides of the largest were in the direction
of the four cardinal points, he concluded that this position must
have been intended, and also that the poles of the earth and
meridians had not deviated since the erection of those structures.
He was made a member of the Academy in 1695, and died in
Paris on the 16th of January 1710.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEADLE<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span>, a town in the Altrincham parliamentary division
of Cheshire, England, 6 m. S. of Manchester, included in the
urban district of Cheadle and Gatley. Pop. (1901) 7916. This
is one of the numerous townships of modern growth which fringe
the southern boundaries of Manchester, and practically form
suburbs of that city. Stockport lies immediately to the east.
The name occurs in the formerly separate villages of Cheadle
Hulme, Cheadle Bulkeley and Cheadle Moseley. There are
cotton printing and bleaching works in the locality. The parish
church of St Giles, Cheadle, is Perpendicular, containing an
altar-tomb of the 15th century for two knights.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CHEADLE<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span>, a market town in the Leek parliamentary division
of Staffordshire, England, 13 m. N.E. of Stafford, and
the terminus of a branch line from Cresswell on the North
Staffordshire railway. Pop. (1901) 5186. The Roman Catholic
church of St Giles, with a lofty spire, was designed by Pugin
and erected in 1846. The interior is lavishly decorated. There
are considerable collieries in the neighbourhood, and silk and
tape works in the town. In the neighbouring Froghall district
limestone is quarried, and there are manufactures of copper.
In Cheadle two fairs of ancient origin are held annually.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CHEATING<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span>, &ldquo;the fraudulently obtaining the property of
another by any deceitful practice not amounting to felony, which
practice is of such a nature that it directly affects, or may
directly affect, the public at large&rdquo; (Stephen, <i>Digest of Criminal
Law</i>, chap. xl. §367). Cheating is either a common law or
statutory offence, and is punishable as a misdemeanour. An
indictment for cheating at common law is of comparatively rare
occurrence, and the statutory crime usually presents itself in the
form of obtaining money by false pretences (<i>q.v.</i>). The word
&ldquo;cheat&rdquo; is a variant of &ldquo;<i>escheat</i>,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the reversion of land to
a lord of the fee through the failure of blood of the tenant.
The shortened form &ldquo;cheater&rdquo; for &ldquo;escheator&rdquo; is found early
in the legal sense, and <i>chetynge</i> appears in the <i>Promptorium
Parvulorum</i>, c. 1440, as the equivalent of <i>confiscatio</i>. In the
16th century &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; occurs in vocabularies of thieves and other
slang, and in such works as the <i>Use of Dice-Play</i> (1532). It is
frequent in Thomas Harman&rsquo;s <i>Caveat</i> or <i>Warening for ... Vagabones</i>
(1567), in the sense of &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; with a descriptive word
attached, <i>e.g.</i> <i>smeling chete</i> = nose. In the tract <i>Mihil Mumchance,
his Discoverie of the Art of Cheating</i>, doubtfully attributed to
Robert Greene (1560-1592), we find that gamesters call themselves
<i>cheaters</i>, &ldquo;borrowing the term from the lawyers.&rdquo; The
sense development is obscure, but it would seem to be due to the
extortionate or fraudulent demands made by legal &ldquo;escheators.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEBICHEV, PAFNUTIY LVOVICH<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (1821-1894), Russian
mathematician, was born at Borovsk on the 26th of May 1821.
He was educated at the university of Moscow, and in 1859
became professor of mathematics in the university of St Petersburg,
a position from which he retired in 1880. He was chosen
a correspondent of the Institute of France in 1860, and succeeded
to the high honour of <i>associé étranger</i> in 1874. He was also a
foreign member of the Royal Society of London. After N.I.
Lobachevskiy he probably ranks as the most distinguished
mathematician Russia has produced. In 1841 he published a
valuable paper, &ldquo;Sur la convergence de la serié de Taylor,&rdquo; in
<i>Crelle&rsquo;s Journal</i>. His best-known papers, however, deal with
prime numbers; in one of these (&ldquo;Sur les nombres premiers,&rdquo;
1850) he established the existence of limits within which must
be comprised the sum of the logarithms of the primes inferior
to a given number. Another question to which he devoted much
attention was that of obtaining rectilinear motion by linkage.
The parallel motion known by his name is a three-bar linkage,
which gives a very close approximation to exact rectilinear
motion, but in spite of all his efforts he failed to devise one that
produced absolutely true rectilinear motion. At last, indeed, he
came to the conclusion that to do so was impossible, and in that
conviction set to work to find a rigorous proof of the impossibility.
While he was engaged on this task the desired linkage, which
moved the highest admiration of J.J. Sylvester, was discovered
and exhibited to him by one of his pupils, named Lipkin, who,
however, it was afterwards found, had been anticipated by
A. Peaucellier. Chebichev further constructed an instrument
for drawing large circles, and an arithmetical machine with
continuous motion. His mathematical writings, which account
for some forty entries in the Royal Society&rsquo;s catalogue of scientific
papers, cover a wide range of subjects, such as the theory of
probabilities, quadratic forms, theory of integrals, gearings, the
construction of geographical maps, &amp;c. He also published a
<i>Traité de la théorie des nombres</i>. He died at St Petersburg on
the 8th of December 1894.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEBOYGAN<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span>, a city and the county-seat of Cheboygan
county, Michigan, U.S.A., on South Channel (between Lakes
Michigan and Huron), at the mouth of Cheboygan river, in the
N. part of the lower peninsula. Pop. (1890) 6235; (1900)
6489, of whom 2101 were foreign-born; <b>(1904) 6730; (1910)
6859.</b> It is served by the Michigan Central and the Detroit &amp;
Mackinac railways, and by steamboat lines to Chicago, Milwaukee,
Detroit, Sault Ste Marie, Green Bay and other lake
ports; and is connected by ferry with Mackinac and Pointe aux
Pins. During a great part of the year small boats ply between
Cheboygan and the head of Crooked Lake, over the &ldquo;Inland
Route.&rdquo; Cheboygan is situated in a fertile farming region, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
which it is a trade centre, and it has lumber mills, tanneries,
paper mills, boiler works, and other manufacturing establishments.
The water-works are owned and operated by the municipality.
The city, at first called Duncan, then Inverness, and
finally Cheboygan, was settled in 1846, incorporated as a village
in 1871, reincorporated in 1877, and chartered as a city in
1889.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHECHENZES<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Tchetchen</span>, or <span class="sc">Khists</span> (<i>Kisti</i>), the last being
the name by which they are known to the Georgians, a people
of the eastern Caucasus occupying the whole of west Daghestan.
They call themselves Nakhtche, &ldquo;people.&rdquo; A wild, fierce people,
they fought desperately against Russian aggression in the 18th
century under Daûd Beg and Oman Khan and Shamyl, and in
the 19th under Khazi-Mollah, and even now some are independent
in the mountain districts. On the surrender of the
chieftain Shamyl to Russia in 1859 numbers of them migrated
into Armenia. In physique the Chechenzes resemble the Circassians,
and have the same haughtiness of carriage. They are
of a generous temperament, very hospitable, but quick to revenge.
They are fond of fine clothes, the women wearing rich
robes with wide, pink silk trousers, silver bracelets and yellow
sandals. Their houses, however, are mere hovels, some dug
out of the ground, others formed of boughs and stones. Before
their subjection to Russia they were remarkable for their independence
of spirit and love of freedom. Everybody was equal,
and they had no slaves except prisoners of war. Government
in each commune was by popular assembly, and the administration
of justice was in the hands of the wronged. Murder and
robbery with violence could be expiated only by death, unless
the criminal allowed his hair to grow and the injured man
consented to shave it himself and take an oath of brotherhood
on the Koran. Otherwise the law of vendetta was fully carried
out with curious details. The wronged man, wrapped in a white
woollen shroud, and carrying a coin to serve as payment to a
priest for saying the prayers for the dead, started out in search
of his enemy. When the offender was found he must fight to a
finish. A remarkable custom among one tribe is that if a
betrothed man or woman dies on the eve of her wedding, the
marriage ceremony is still performed, the dead being formally
united to the living before witnesses, the father, in case it is the
girl who dies, never failing to pay her dowry. The religion of
the Chechenzes is Mahommedanism, mixed, however, with
Christian doctrines and observances. Three churches near Kistin
in honour of St George and the Virgin are visited as places of
pilgrimage, and rams are there offered as sacrifices. The
Chechenzes number upwards of 200,000. They speak a distinct
language, of which there are said to be twenty separate dialects.</p>

of Somersetshire, England, 22 m. S.W. of Bristol by a branch
of the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901) 1975. The town,
with its Perpendicular church and its picturesque market-cross,
lies below the south-western face of the Mendip Hills, which rise
sharply from 600 to 800 ft. To the west stretches the valley of
the river Axe, broad, low and flat. A fine gorge opening from
the hills immediately upon the site of the town is known as
Cheddar cliffs from the sheer walls which flank it; the contrast
of its rocks and rich vegetation, and the falls of a small stream
traversing it, make up a beautiful scene admired by many
visitors. Several stalactitical caverns are also seen, and prehistoric
British and Roman relics discovered in and near them
are preserved in a small museum. The two caverns most frequently
visited are called respectively Cox&rsquo;s and Gough&rsquo;s; in
each, but especially in the first, there is a remarkable collection
of fantastic and beautiful stalactitical forms. There are other
caverns of greater extent but less beauty, but their extent is not
completely explored. The remains discovered in the caves give
evidence of British and Roman settlements at Cheddar (<i>Cedre</i>,
<i>Chedare</i>), which was a convenient trade centre. The manor of
Cheddar was a royal demesne in Saxon times, and the witenagemot
was held there in 966 and 968. It was granted by John in
1204 to Hugh, archdeacon of Wells, who sold it to the bishop of
Bath and Wells in 1229, whose successors were overlords until
1553, when the bishop granted it to the king. It is now owned
by the marquis of Bath. By a charter of 1231 extensive liberties
in the manor of Cheddar were granted to Bishop Joceline, who
by a charter of 1235 obtained the right to hold a weekly market
and fair. By a charter of Edward III. (1337) Cheddar was
removed from the king&rsquo;s forest of Mendip. The market was
discontinued about 1690. Fairs are now held on the 4th of May
and the 29th of October under the original grants. The name
of Cheddar is given to a well-known species of cheese (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dairy</a></span>),
the manufacture of which began in the 17th century in the
town and neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEDUBA<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">Man-aung</span>, an island in the Bay of Bengal,
situated 10 m. from the coast of Arakan, between 18° 40&prime; and
18° 56&prime; N. lat., and between 93° 31&prime; and 93° 50&prime; E. long. It
forms part of the Kyaukpyu district of Arakan. It extends
about 20 m. in length from N. to S., and 17 m. from E. to W.,
and its area of 220 sq. m. supports a population of 26,899 (in
1901). The channel between the island and the mainland is
navigable for boats, but not for large vessels. The surface of the
interior is richly diversified by hill and dale, and in the southern
portion some of the heights exceed a thousand feet in elevation.
There are various indications of former volcanic activity, and
along the coast are earthy cones covered with green-sward, from
which issue springs of muddy water emitting bubbles of gas.
Copper, iron and silver ore have been discovered; but the
island is chiefly noted for its petroleum wells, the oil derived
from which is of excellent quality, and is extensively used in the
composition of paint, as it preserves wood from the ravages of
insects. Timber is not abundant, but the gamboge tree and
the wood-oil tree are found of a good size. Tobacco, cotton,
sugar-cane, hemp and indigo are grown, and the staple article
is rice, which is of superior quality, and the chief article of export.
The inhabitants of the island are mainly Maghs. Cheduba fell
to the Burmese in the latter part of the 18th century. From
them it was captured in 1824 by the British, whose possession
of it was confirmed in 1826 by the treaty concluded with the
Burmese at Yandaboo.</p>

<hr class="art" />

<p><span class="bold">CHEERING<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span>, the uttering or making of sounds encouraging,
stimulating or exciting to action, indicating approval of acclaiming
or welcoming persons, announcements of events and the
like. The word &ldquo;cheer&rdquo; meant originally face, countenance,
expression, and came through the O. Fr. into Mid. Eng. in the
13th century from the Low Lat. <i>cara</i>, head; this is generally
referred to the Gr. <span class="grk" title="kara">&#954;&#940;&#961;&#945;</span>. <i>Cara</i> is used by the 6th-century poet
Flavius Cresconius Corippus, &ldquo;Postquam venere verendam
Caesaris ante caram&rdquo; (<i>In Laudem Justini Minoris</i>). &ldquo;Cheer&rdquo;
was at first qualified with epithets, both of joy and gladness and
of sorrow; compare &ldquo;She thanked Dyomede for alle ... his
gode chere&rdquo; (Chaucer, <i>Troylus</i>) with &ldquo;If they sing ... &rsquo;tis
with so dull a cheere&rdquo; (Shakespeare, <i>Sonnets</i>, xcvii.). An early
transference in meaning was to hospitality or entertainment,
and hence to food and drink, &ldquo;good cheer.&rdquo; The sense of a
shout of encouragement or applause is a late use. Defoe (<i>Captain
Singleton</i>) speaks of it as a sailor&rsquo;s word, and the meaning does
not appear in Johnson. Of the different words or rather sounds
that are used in cheering, &ldquo;hurrah,&rdquo; though now generally
looked on as the typical British form of cheer, is found in various
forms in German, Scandinavian, Russian (<i>urá</i>), French (<i>houra</i>).
It is probably onomatopoeic in origin; some connect it with
such words as &ldquo;hurry,&rdquo; &ldquo;whirl&rdquo;; the meaning would then be
&ldquo;haste,&rdquo; to encourage speed or onset in battle. The English
&ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; was preceded by &ldquo;huzza,&rdquo; stated to be a sailor&rsquo;s
word, and generally connected with &ldquo;heeze,&rdquo; to hoist, probably
being one of the cries that sailors use when hauling or hoisting.
The German <i>hoch</i>, seen in full in <i>hoch lebe der Kaiser</i>, &amp;c., the
French <i>vive</i>, Italian and Spanish <i>viva</i>, <i>evviva</i>, are cries rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span>
of acclamation than encouragement. The Japanese shout
<i>banzai</i> became familiar during the Russo-Japanese War. In
reports of parliamentary and other debates the insertion of
&ldquo;cheers&rdquo; at any point in a speech indicates that approval was
shown by members of the House by emphatic utterances of
&ldquo;hear hear.&rdquo; Cheering may be tumultuous, or it may be
conducted rhythmically by prearrangement, as in the case of
the &ldquo;Hip-hip-hip&rdquo; by way of introduction to a simultaneous
&ldquo;hurrah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rhythmical cheering has been developed to its greatest
extent in America in the college yells, which may be regarded as
a development of the primitive war-cry; this custom has no
real analogue at English schools and universities, but the New
Zealand football team in 1907 familiarized English crowds at
their matches with a similar sort of war-cry adopted from the
Maoris. In American schools and colleges there is usually one
cheer for the institution as a whole and others for the different
classes. The oldest and simplest are those of the New England
colleges. The original yells of Harvard and Yale are identical
in form, being composed of <i>rah</i> (abbreviation of <i>hurrah</i>) nine
times repeated, shouted in unison with the name of the university
at the end. The Yale cheer is given faster than that of Harvard.
Many institutions have several different yells, a favourite
variation being the name of the college shouted nine times in a
slow and prolonged manner. The best known of these variants
is the Yale cheer, partly taken from the <i>Frogs</i> of Aristophanes,
which runs thus:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p class="i05">Siss, boom, ah; Princeton!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;railroad cheer&rdquo; is like the foregoing, but begun very
slowly and broadly, and gradually accelerated to the end, which
is enunciated as fast as possible. Many cheers are formed
like that of Toronto University:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Varsitý, varsitý,</p>
<p class="i05">V-a-r-s-í-t-y (spelled)</p>

<p class="i05">Vár-sí-tý,</p>
<p class="i05">Rah, rah, rah!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Another variety of yell is illustrated by that of the School
of Practical Science of Toronto University:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Who are we? Can&rsquo;t you guess?</p>
<p class="i05">We are from the S.P.S.!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cheer of the United States Naval Academy is an imitation
of a nautical syren. The Amherst cheer is:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p>&ldquo;Amherst! Amherst! Amherst! Rah! Rah!</p>
<p class="i05">Amherst! Rah! Rah!</p>
<p class="i05">Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Amherst!&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Besides the cheers of individual institutions there are some
common to all, generally used to compliment some successful
athlete or popular professor. One of the oldest examples of
these personal cheers is:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Who was George Washington?</p>
<p class="i05">First in war,</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>College yells are used particularly at athletic contests. In
any large college there are several leaders, chosen by the students,
who stand in front and call for the different songs and cheers,

features of inter-collegiate and scholastic athletic contests in
America.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEESE<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (Lat. <i>caseus</i>), a solidified preparation from milk, the
essential constituent of which is the proteinous or nitrogenous
substance <i>casein</i>. All cheese contains in addition some proportion
of fatty matter or butter, and in the more valuable varieties the
butter present is often greater in amount than the casein. Cheese
being thus a compound substance of no definite composition is
found in commerce of many different varieties and qualities;
and such qualities are generally recognized by the names of the
localities in which they are manufactured. The principal distinctions
arise from differences in the composition and condition
of the milk operated upon, from variations in the method of
preparation and curing, and from the use of the milk of other
animals besides the cow, as, for example, the goat and the ewe,
from the milk of both of which cheese is manufactured on a
commercial scale. For details about different cheeses and cheese-making,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dairy</a></span>. From the Urdu <i>chiz</i> (&ldquo;thing&rdquo;) comes the
slang expression &ldquo;the cheese,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;the perfect thing,&rdquo;
apparently from Anglo-Indian usage.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A useful summary of the history and manufacture of all sorts of
cheeses, under their different names, is given in Bulletin 105 of the
Bureau of Animal Industry (United States Dep. of Agriculture),

<p><span class="bold">CHEESE CLOTH<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span>, the name given to cloth, usually made from
flax or tow yarns, of an open character, resembling a fine riddle
or sieve, used for wrapping cheese. A finer quality and texture
is made for women&rsquo;s gowns. A similar cloth is used for inside
linings in the upholstery trade, and for the ground of embroidery.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEETA<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Chita</span>), or <span class="sc">Hunting-Leopard</span> (<i>Cynaelurus jubatus</i>,
formerly known as <i>Gueparda jubata</i>), a member of the family
<i>Felidae</i>, distinguished by its claws being only partially retractile
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carnivora</a></span>). The cheeta attains a length of 3 to 4 ft.;
it is of a pale fulvous colour, marked with numerous spots of
black on the upper surface and sides, and is nearly white beneath.
The fur is somewhat crisp, altogether lacking the sleekness which
characterizes the fur of the typical cats, and the tail is long and
somewhat bushy at the extremity. In confinement the cheeta
soon becomes fond of those who are kind to it, and gives evidence
of its attachment in an open, dog-like manner. The cheeta is
found throughout Africa and southern Asia, and has been employed
for centuries in India and Persia in hunting antelopes
and other game. According to Sir W. Jones, this mode of
hunting originated with Hushing, king of Persia, 865 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and
afterwards became so popular that certain of the Mongol
emperors were in the habit of being accompanied in their sporting
expeditions by a thousand hunting leopards. In prosecuting
this sport at the present day the cheeta is conveyed to the field
in a low car without sides, hooded and chained like hunting-birds
in Europe in the days of falconry. When a herd of deer
or antelopes is seen, the car, which bears a close resemblance to
the ordinary vehicles used by the peasants, is usually brought
within 200 yds. of the game before the latter takes alarm; the
cheeta is then let loose and the hood removed from its eyes. No
sooner does it see the herd, than dropping from the car on the side
remote from its <span class="correction" title="amended from sprey">prey</span>, it approaches stealthily, making use of
whatever means of concealment the nature of the ground permits,
until observed, when making a few gigantic bounds, it generally
arrives in the midst of the herd and brings down its victim with
a stroke of its paw. The sportsman then approaches, draws off
a bowl of the victim&rsquo;s blood, and puts it before the cheeta, which
is again hooded and led back to the car. Should it not succeed
in reaching the herd in the first few bounds, it makes no further
effort to pursue, but retires seemingly dispirited to the car. In
Africa the cheeta is only valued for its skin, which is worn by
chiefs and other people of rank. It should be added that in
India the name cheeta (chita) is applied also to the leopard.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEFFONIER<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span>, properly <span class="sc">Chiffonier</span>, a piece of furniture
differentiated from the sideboard by its smaller size and by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span>
enclosure of the whole of the front by doors. Its name (which
comes from the French for a rag-gatherer) suggests that it was
originally intended as a receptacle for odds and ends which had
no place elsewhere, but it now usually serves the purpose of a
sideboard. It is a remote and illegitimate descendant of the
cabinet; it has rarely been elegant and never beautiful. It was
one of the many curious developments of the mixed taste, at
once cumbrous and bizarre, which prevailed in furniture during
the Empire period in England. The earliest cheffoniers date
from that time; they are usually of rosewood&mdash;the favourite
timber of that moment; their &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; (the technical name
for knobs, handles and escutcheons) was most commonly of
brass, and there was very often a raised shelf with a pierced brass
gallery at the back. The doors were well panelled and often
edged with brass-beading, while the feet were pads or claws, or,
in the choicer examples, sphinxes in gilded bronze. Cheffoniers
are still made in England in cheap forms and in great number.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEH-KIANG<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span>, an eastern province of China, bounded N. by
the province of Kiang-su, E. by the sea, S. by the province of
Fu-kien, and W. by the provinces of Kiang-si and Ngan-hui.
It occupies an area of about 36,000 sq. m., and contains a population
of 11,800,000. With the exception of a small portion of
the great delta plain, which extends across the frontier from the
province of Kiang-su, and in which are situated the famous
cities of Hu Chow, Ka-hing, Hang-chow, Shao-Sing and Ning-po,
the province forms a portion of the Nan-shan of south-eastern
China, and is hilly throughout. The Nan-shan ranges run
through the centre of the province from south-west to north-east,
and divide it into a northern portion, the greater part of
which is drained by the Tsien-t&rsquo;ang-kiang, and a southern
portion which is chiefly occupied by the Ta-chi basin. The
valleys enclosed between the mountain ranges are numerous,
fertile, and for the most part of exquisite beauty. The hilly
portion of the province furnishes large supplies of tea, and in the
plain which extends along the coast, north of Ning-po, a great
quantity of silk is produced. In minerals the province is poor.
Coal and iron are occasionally met with, and traces of copper
ore are to be found in places, but none of these minerals exists
in sufficiently large deposits to make mining remunerative. The
province, however, produces cotton, rice, ground-nuts, wheat,
indigo, tallow and beans in abundance. The principal cities
are Hang-chow, which is famed for the beauty of its surroundings,
Ning-po, which has been frequented by foreign ships ever since
the Portuguese visited it in the 16th century, and Wênchow.
Opposite Ning-po, at a distance of about 50 m., lies the island of
Chusan, the largest of a group bearing that general name. This
island is 21 m. long, and about 50 m. in circumference. It is
very mountainous, and is surrounded by numerous islands and
islets. On its south side stands the walled town of Ting-hai,
in front of which is the principal harbour. The population is
returned as 50,000.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEKE, SIR JOHN<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1514-1557), English classical scholar,
was the son of Peter Cheke, esquire-bedell of Cambridge University.
He was educated at St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where
he became a fellow in 1529. While there he adopted the principles
of the Reformation. His learning gained him an exhibition
from the king, and in 1540, on Henry VIII.&rsquo;s foundation of the
regius professorships, he was elected to the chair of Greek.
Amongst his pupils at St John&rsquo;s were Lord Burghley, who married
Cheke&rsquo;s sister Mary, and Roger Ascham, who in <i>The Schoolmaster</i>
gives Cheke the highest praise for scholarship and
character. Together with Sir Thomas Smith, he introduced
a new method of Greek pronunciation very similar to that commonly
used in England in the 19th century. It was strenuously
opposed in the University, where the continental method
prevailed, and Bishop Gardiner, as chancellor, issued a decree
against it (June 1542); but Cheke ultimately triumphed. On
the 10th of July 1554, he was chosen as tutor to Prince Edward,
and after his pupil&rsquo;s accession to the throne he continued his instructions.
Cheke took a fairly active share in public life; he
sat, as member for Bletchingley, for the parliaments of 1547 and
1552-1553; he was made provost of King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge
(April 1, 1548), was one of the commissioners for visiting that
university as well as Oxford and Eton, and was appointed with
seven divines to draw up a body of laws for the governance
of the church. On the 11th of October 1551 he was knighted;
in 1553 he was made one of the secretaries of state, and sworn
of the privy council. His zeal for Protestantism induced him
to follow the duke of Northumberland, and he filled the office
of secretary of state for Lady Jane Grey during her nine days&rsquo;
reign. In consequence Mary threw him into the Tower (July 27,
1553), and confiscated his wealth. He was, however, released
on the 13th of September 1554, and granted permission to travel
abroad. He went first to Basel, then visited Italy, giving
lectures in Greek at Padua, and finally settled at Strassburg,
teaching Greek for his living. In the spring of 1556 he visited
Brussels to see his wife; on his way back, between Brussels and
Antwerp, he and Sir Peter Carew were treacherously seized
(May 15) by order of Philip of Spain, hurried over to England,
and imprisoned in the Tower. Cheke was visited by two priests
and by Dr John Feckenham, dean of St Paul&rsquo;s, whom he had
formerly tried to convert to Protestantism, and, terrified by a
threat of the stake, he gave way and was received into the Church
of Rome by Cardinal Pole, being cruelly forced to make two
public recantations. Overcome with shame, he did not long survive,
but died in London on the 13th of September 1557, carrying,
as T. Fuller says (<i>Church History</i>), &ldquo;God&rsquo;s pardon and all
good men&rsquo;s pity along with him.&rdquo; About 1547 Cheke married
Mary, daughter of Richard Hill, sergeant of the wine-cellar to
Henry VIII., and by her he had three sons. The descendants
of one of these, Henry, known only for his translation of an
Italian morality play <i>Freewyl</i> (<i>Tragedio del Libero Arbitrio</i>) by
Nigri de Bassano, settled at Pyrgo in Essex.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Thomas Wilson, in the epistle prefixed to his translation of the
Olynthiacs of Demosthenes (1570), has a long and most interesting
eulogy of Cheke; and Thomas Nash, in <i>To the Gentlemen Students</i>,
prefixed to Robert Greene&rsquo;s <i>Menaphon</i> (1589), calls him &ldquo;the
Exchequer of eloquence, Sir Ihon Cheke, a man of men, supernaturally
traded in all tongues.&rdquo; Many of Cheke&rsquo;s works are still
in MS., some have been altogether lost. One of the most interesting
from a historical point of view is the <i>Hurt of Sedition how greueous
it is to a Communewelth</i> (1549), written on the occasion of Ket&rsquo;s
rebellion, republished in 1569, 1576 and 1641, on the last occasion
with a life of the author by Gerard Langbaine. Others are <i>D.
Joannis Chrysostomi homiliae duae</i> (1543), <i>D. Joannis Chrysostomi de
providentia Dei</i> (1545), <i>The Gospel according to St Matthew ...
translated</i> (c. 1550; ed. James Goodwin, 1843), <i>De obitu Martini
Buceri</i> (1551), (Leo VI.&rsquo;s) <i>de Apparatu bellico</i> (Basel, 1554; but
dedicated to Henry VIII., 1544), <i>Carmen Heroicum, aut epitaphium
in Antonium Deneium</i> (1551), <i>De pronuntiatione Graecae ... linguae</i>
(Basel, 1555). He also translated several Greek works, and lectured
admirably upon Demosthenes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHELLIAN<a name="ar50" id="ar50"></a></span>, the name given by the French anthropologist
G. de Mortillet to the first epoch of the Quaternary period when
the earliest human remains are discoverable. The word is
derived from the French town Chelles in the department of
Seine-et-Marne. The climate of the Chellian epoch was warm
and humid as evidenced by the wild growth of fig-trees and
laurels. The animals characteristic of the epoch are the <i>Elephas
antiquus</i>, the rhinoceros, the cave-bear, the hippopotamus and
the striped hyaena. Man existed and belonged to the Neanderthal
type. The implements characteristic of the period are flints
chipped into leaf-shaped forms and held in the hand when used.
The drift-beds of St Acheul (Amiens), of Menchecourt (Abbeville),
of Hoxne (Suffolk), and the detrital laterite of Madras are considered
by de Mortillet to be synchronous with the Chellian beds.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHELMSFORD, FREDERIC THESIGER<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span>, <span class="sc">1st Baron</span> (1794-1878),
lord chancellor of England, was the third son of Charles
Thesiger, and was born in London on the 15th of April 1794.
His father, collector of customs at St Vincent&rsquo;s, was the son of
a Saxon gentleman who had migrated to England and become
secretary to Lord Rockingham, and was the brother of Sir
Frederic Thesiger, naval A.D.C. to Nelson at Copenhagen.
Young Frederic Thesiger was originally destined for a naval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
career, and he served as a midshipman on board the &ldquo;Cambrian&rdquo;
frigate in 1807 at the second bombardment of Copenhagen. His
only surviving brother, however, died about this time, and he
became entitled to succeed to a valuable estate in the West
Indies, so it was decided that he should leave the navy and
study law, with a view to practising in the West Indies and
eventually managing his property in person. Another change
of fortune, however, awaited him, for a volcano destroyed the
family estate, and he was thrown back upon his prospect of a
legal practice in the West Indies. He proceeded to enter at
Gray&rsquo;s Inn in 1813, and was called on the 18th of November
1818, another change in his prospects being brought about by
the strong advice of Godfrey Sykes, a special pleader in whose
chambers he had been a pupil, that he should remain to try his
fortune in England. He accordingly joined the home circuit,
and soon got into good practice at the Surrey sessions, while he
also made a fortunate purchase in buying the right to appear
in the old palace court (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lord Steward</a></span>). In 1824 he distinguished
himself by his defence of Joseph Hunt when on his
trial at Hertford with John Thurtell for the murder of Wm.
Weare; and eight years later at Chelmsford assizes he won a
hard-fought action in an ejectment case after three trials, to
which he attributed so much of his subsequent success that when
he was raised to the peerage he assumed the title Lord Chelmsford.
In 1834 he was made king&rsquo;s counsel, and in 1835 was
briefed in the Dublin election inquiry which unseated Daniel
O&rsquo;Connell. In 1840 he was elected M.P. for Woodstock. In
1844 he became solicitor-general, but having ceased to enjoy
the favour of the duke of Marlborough, lost his seat for Woodstock
and had to find another at Abingdon. In 1845 he became
attorney-general, holding the post until the fall of the Peel
administration on the 3rd of July 1846. Thus by three days
Thesiger missed being chief justice of the common pleas, for on
the 6th of July Sir Nicholas Tindal died, and the seat on the
bench, which would have been Thesiger&rsquo;s as of right, fell to
the Liberal attorney-general, Sir Thomas Wilde. Sir Frederic
Thesiger remained in parliament, changing his seat, however,
again in 1852, and becoming member for Stamford. During
this period he enjoyed a very large practice at the bar, being
employed in many <i>causes célèbres</i>. On Lord Derby coming into
office for the second time in 1858, Sir Frederic Thesiger was
raised straight from the bar to the lord chancellorship (as were
Lord Brougham, Lord Selborne and Lord Halsbury). In the
following year Lord Derby resigned and his cabinet was broken
up. Again in 1866, on Lord Derby coming into office for the third
time, Lord Chelmsford became lord chancellor for a short period.
In 1868 Lord Derby retired, and Disraeli, who took his place as
prime minister, wished for Lord Cairns as lord chancellor. Lord
Chelmsford was very sore at his supersession and the manner
of it, but, according to Lord Malmesbury he retired under a
compact made before he took office. Ten years later Lord
Chelmsford died in London on the 5th of October 1878. Lord
Chelmsford had married in 1822 Anna Maria Tinling. He left
four sons and three daughters, of whom the eldest, Frederick
Augustus, 2nd Baron Chelmsford (1827-1905), earned distinction
as a soldier, while the third, Alfred Henry Thesiger (1838-1880)
was made a lord justice of appeal and a privy councillor in 1877,
at the early age of thirty-nine, but died only three years later.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHELMSFORD<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span>, a market town and municipal borough, and
the county town of Essex, England, in the Chelmsford parliamentary
division, 30 m. E.N.E. from London by the Great
Eastern railway. Pop. (1901) 12,580. It is situated in the
valley of the Chelmer, at the confluence of the Cann, and has
communication by the river with Maldon and the Blackwater
estuary 11 m. east. Besides the parish church of St Mary, a
graceful Perpendicular edifice, largely rebuilt, the town has
a grammar school founded by Edward VI., an endowed charity
school and a museum. It is the seat of the county assizes and
quarter sessions, and has a handsome shire hall; the county gaol
is near the town. Its corn and cattle markets are among the
largest in the county; for the first a fine exchange is provided.
In the centre of the square in which the corn exchange is situated
stands a bronze statue of Lord Chief-Justice Tindal (1776-1846),
a native of the parish. There are agricultural implement and
iron foundries, large electric light and engineering works,
breweries, tanneries, maltings and extensive corn mills. There
is a race-course 2 m. south of the town. The borough is under
a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area 2308 acres.</p>

<p>A place of settlement since Palaeolithic times, Chelmsford
(<i>Chilmersford, Chelmeresford, Chelmesford</i>) owed its importance
to its position on the road from London to Colchester. It consisted
of two manors: that of Moulsham, which remained in the
possession of Westminster Abbey from Saxon times till the reign
of Henry VIII., when it was granted to Thomas Mildmay; and
that of Bishop&rsquo;s Hall, which was held by the bishops of London
from the reign of Edward the Confessor to 1545, when it passed
to the crown and was granted to Thomas Mildmay in 1563. The
medieval history of Chelmsford centred round the manor of
Bishop&rsquo;s Hall. Early in the 12th century Bishop Maurice built
the bridge over the Chelmer which brought the road from London
directly through the town, thus making it an important stopping-place.
The town was not incorporated until 1888. In 1225
Chelmsford was made the centre for the collection of fifteenths
from the county of Essex, and in 1227 it became the regular seat
of assizes and quarter-sessions. Edward I. confirmed Bishop
Richard de Gravesend in his rights of frank pledge in Chelmsford
in 1290, and in 1395 Richard II. granted the return of writs to
Bishop Robert de Braybroke. In 1377 writs were issued for the
return of representatives from Chelmsford to parliament, but
no return of members has been found. In 1199 the bishop
obtained the grant of a weekly market at the yearly rent of one
palfrey, and in 1201 that of an annual fair, now discontinued,
for four days from the feast of St Philip and St James.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHELSEA<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span>, a western metropolitan borough of London,
England, bounded E. by the city of Westminster, N.W. by
Kensington, S.W. by Fulham, and S. by the river Thames.
Pop. (1901) 73,842. Its chief thoroughfare is Sloane Street,
containing handsome houses and good shops, running south from
Knightsbridge to Sloane Square. Hence King&rsquo;s Road leads
west, a wholly commercial highway, named in honour of Charles
II., and recalling the king&rsquo;s private road from St James&rsquo;s Palace
to Fulham, which was maintained until the reign of George IV.
The main roads south communicate with the Victoria or Chelsea,
Albert and Battersea bridges over the Thames. The beautiful
Chelsea embankment, planted with trees and lined with fine
houses and, in part, with public gardens, stretches between
Victoria and Battersea bridges. The better residential portion
of Chelsea is the eastern, near Sloane Street and along the river;
the western, extending north to Fulham Road, is mainly a poor quarter.</p>

<p>Chelsea, especially the riverside district, abounds in historical
associations. At <i>Cealchythe</i> a synod was held in 785. A
similar name occurs in a Saxon charter of the 11th century and
in Domesday; in the 16th century it is <i>Chelcith</i>. The later
termination <i>ey</i> or <i>ea</i> was associated with the insular character of
the land, and the prefix with a gravel bank (<i>ceosol</i>; cf. Chesil
Bank, Dorsetshire) thrown up by the river; but the early
suffix <i>hythe</i> is common in the meaning of a haven. The manor
was originally in the possession of Westminster Abbey, but its
history is fragmentary until Tudor times. It then came into
the hands of Henry VIII., passed from him to his wife Catharine
Parr, and thereafter had a succession of owners, among whom
were the Howards, to whom it was granted by Queen Elizabeth,
and the Cheynes, from whom it was purchased in 1712 by Sir
Hans Sloane, after which it passed to the Cadogans. The
memorials which crowd the picturesque church and churchyard
of St Luke near the river, commonly known as the Old Church,
to a great extent epitomize the history of Chelsea. Such are
those of Sir Thomas More (d. 1535); Lord Bray, lord of the
manor (1539), his father and son; Lady Jane Guyldeford,
duchess of Northumberland, who died &ldquo;at her maner of Chelse&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
in 1555; Lord and Lady Dacre (1594-1595); Sir John Lawrence
(1638); Lady Jane Cheyne (1698); Francis Thomas, &ldquo;director
of the china porcelain manufactory, Lawrence Street, Chelsea&rdquo;
(1770); Sir Hans Sloane (1753); Thomas Shadwell, poet
laureate (1602); Woodfall the printer of <i>Junius</i> (1844), and
many others. More&rsquo;s tomb is dated 1532, as he set it up himself,
though it is doubtful whether he lies beneath it. His house was
near the present Beaufort Street. In the 18th and 19th centuries
Chelsea, especially the parts about the embankment and Cheyne
Walk, was the home of many eminent men, particularly of
writers and artists, with whom this pleasant quarter has long
been in favour. Thus in the earlier part of the period named,
Atterbury and Swift lived in Church Lane, Steele and Smollett
in Monmouth House. Later, the names of Turner, Rossetti,
Whistler, Leigh Hunt, Carlyle (whose house in Cheyne Row
is preserved as a public memorial), Count D&rsquo;Orsay, and Isambard
Brunel, are intimately connected with Chelsea. At Lindsey
House Count Zinzendorf established a Moravian Society (c. 1750).
Sir Robert Walpole&rsquo;s residence was extant till 1810; and till 1824
the bishops of Winchester had a palace in Cheyne Walk. Queen&rsquo;s
House, the home of D.G. Rossetti (when it was called Tudor
House), is believed to take name from Catharine of Braganza.</p>

<p>Chelsea was noted at different periods for two famous places
of entertainment, Ranelagh (<i>q.v.</i>) in the second half of the 18th
century, and Cremorne Gardens (<i>q.v.</i>) in the middle of the 19th.
Don Saltero&rsquo;s museum, which formed the attraction of a popular
coffee-house, was formed of curiosities from Sir Hans Sloane&rsquo;s
famous collections. It was Sloane who gave to the Apothecaries&rsquo;
Company the ground which they had leased in 1673 for the
Physick Garden, which is still extant, but ceased in 1902 to be
maintained by the Company. At Chelsea Sir John Danvers
(d. 1655) introduced the Italian style of gardening which was
so greatly admired by Bacon and soon after became prevalent
in England. Chelsea was formerly famous for a manufacture
of buns; the original Chelsea bun-house, claiming royal patronage,
stood until 1839, and one of its successors until 1888. The
porcelain works existed for some 25 years before 1769, when
they were sold and removed to Derby. Examples of the original
Chelsea ware (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ceramics</a></span>) are of great value.</p>

<p>Of buildings and institutions the most notable is Chelsea
Royal Hospital for invalid soldiers, initiated by Charles II.
(according to tradition on the suggestion of Nell Gwynne), and
opened in 1694. The hospital itself accommodates upwards of
500 men, but a system of out-pensioning was found necessary
from the outset, and now relieves large numbers throughout
the empire. The picturesque building by Wren stands in extensive
grounds, which include the former Ranelagh Gardens. A
theological college (King James&rsquo;s) formerly occupied the site;
it was founded in 1610 and was intended to be of great size, but
the scheme was unsuccessful, and only a small part of the buildings
was erected. In the vicinity are the Chelsea Barracks
(not actually in the borough). The Royal Military Asylum for
boys, commonly called the Duke of York&rsquo;s school, founded in
1801 by Frederick, duke of York, for the education of children
connected with the army, was removed in 1909 to new quarters
at Dover. Other institutions are the Whitelands training
college for school-mistresses, in which Ruskin took deep interest;
the St Mark&rsquo;s college for school-masters; the Victoria and the
Cheyne hospitals for children, a cancer hospital, the South-western
polytechnic, and a public library containing an excellent
collection relative to local history.</p>

<p>The parliamentary borough of Chelsea returns one member,

Kensington. The borough council consists of a mayor, 6 aldermen

<p><span class="bold">CHELSEA<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span>, a city of Suffolk county, Massachusetts, U.S.A.,
a suburb of Boston. Pop. (1890) 27,909; (1900) 34,072, of
whom 11,203 were foreign-born; (1910) 32,452. It is situated
on a peninsula between the Mystic and Chelsea rivers,
and Charlestown and East Boston, and is connected with
East Boston and Charlestown by bridges. It is served by the
Boston &amp; Maine and (for freight) by the Boston &amp; Albany
railways. The United States maintains here naval and marine
hospitals, and the state a soldiers&rsquo; home. Chelsea&rsquo;s interests
are primarily industrial. The value of the city&rsquo;s factory products
in 1905 was $13,879,159, the principal items being rubber and
elastic goods ($3,635,211) and boots and shoes ($2,044,250.)
The manufacture of stoves, and of mucilage and paste are
important industries. Flexible tubing for electric wires (first
made at Chelsea 1889) and art tiles are important products.
The first settlement was established in 1624 by Samuel Maverick
(c. 1602-c. 1670), the first settler (about 1629) of Noddle&rsquo;s
Island (or East Boston), and one of the first slave-holders in
Massachusetts; a loyalist and Churchman, in 1664 he was
appointed with three others by Charles II. on an important
commission sent to Massachusetts and the other New England
colonies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks"> Nicolls, Richard</a></span>), and spent the last years of
his life in New York. Until 1739, under the name of Winnisimmet,
Chelsea formed a part of Boston, but in that year it was
made a township; it became a city in 1857. In May 1775 a
British schooner in the Mystic defended by a force of marines
was taken by colonial militia under General John Stark and
Israel Putnam,&mdash;one of the first conflicts of the War of Independence.
A terrible fire swept the central part of the city on
the 12th of April 1908.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHELTENHAM<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span>, a municipal and parliamentary borough of
Gloucestershire, England, 109 m. W. by N. of London by the
Great Western railway; served also by the west and north
line of the Midland railway. Pop. (1901) 49,439. The town is
well situated in the valley of the Chelt, a small tributary of the
Severn, under the high line of the Cotteswold Hills to the east,
and is in high repute as a health resort. Mineral springs were
accidentally discovered in 1716. The Montpellier and Pittville
Springs supply handsome pump rooms standing in public
gardens, and are the property of the corporation. The Montpellier
waters are sulphated, and are valuable for their diuretic
effect, and as a stimulant to the liver and alimentary canal. The
alkaline-saline waters of Pittville are efficacious against diseases
resulting from excess of uric acid. The parish church of St Mary
dates from the 14th century, but is almost completely modernized.
The town, moreover, is wholly modern in appearance.
Assembly rooms opened in 1815 by the duke of Wellington were
removed in 1901. A new town hall, including a central spa and
assembly rooms, was opened in 1903. There are numerous other
handsome buildings, especially in High Street, and the Promenade
forms a beautiful broad thoroughfare, lined with trees.
The town is famous as an educational centre. Cheltenham
College (1842) provides education for boys in three departments,
classical, military and commercial; and includes a preparatory
school. The Ladies&rsquo; College (1854), long conducted by Miss
Beale (<i>q.v.</i>), is one of the most successful in England. The
Normal Training College was founded in 1846 for the training
of teachers, male and female, in national and parochial schools.
A free grammar school was founded in 1568 by Richard Pate,
recorder of Gloucester. The art gallery and museum may be
mentioned also. The parliamentary borough returns one
member. The municipal borough is under a mayor, 6 aldermen
and 18 councillors. Area, 4726 acres. The urban district of
Charlton Kings (pop. 3806) forms a south-eastern suburb of
Cheltenham.</p>

<p>The site of a British village and burying-ground, Cheltenham
(<i>Celtanhomme</i>, <i>Chiltham</i>, <i>Chelteham</i>) was a village with a church
in 803. The manor belonged to the crown; it was granted to
Henry de Bohun, earl of Hereford, late in the 12th century, but
in 1199 was exchanged for other lands with the king. It was
granted to William de Longespée, earl of Salisbury, in 1219, but
resumed on his death and granted in dower to Eleanor of Provence
in 1243. In 1252 the abbey of Fécamp purchased the
manor, and it afterwards belonged to the priory of Cormeille,
but was confiscated in 1415 as the possession of an alien priory,
and was granted in 1461 to the abbey of Lyon, by which it was
held until, once more returning to the crown at the Dissolution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
it was granted to the family of Dutton. The town is first mentioned
in 1223, when William de Longespée leased the benefit
of the markets, fairs and hundred of Cheltenham to the men of
the town for three years; the lease was renewed by Henry III.
in 1226, and again in 1230 for ten years. A market town in the
time of Camden, it was governed by commissioners from the
18th century in 1876, when it was incorporated; it became a
parliamentary borough in 1832. Henry III. in 1230 had granted
to the men of Cheltenham a market on each Thursday, and a fair
on the vigil, feast and morrow of St James. Although Camden
mentions a considerable trade in malt, the spinning of woollen
yarn was the only industry in 1779. After the discovery of
springs in 1716, and the erection of a pump-room in 1738, Cheltenham
rapidly became fashionable, the visit of George III. and the
royal princesses in 1788 ensuring its popularity.</p>

of the ancient Greeks, which had a convex back of tortoiseshell
or of wood shaped like the shell. The word <i>chelys</i> was used
in allusion to the oldest lyre of the Greeks which was said to
have been invented by Hermes. According to tradition he was
attracted by sounds of music while walking on the banks of the
Nile, and found they proceeded from the shell of a tortoise across
which were stretched tendons which the wind had set in vibration
(<i>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</i>, 47-51). The word has been applied
arbitrarily since classic times to various stringed instruments,
some bowed and some twanged, probably owing to the back
being much vaulted. Kircher (<i>Musurgia</i>, i. 486) applied the
name of <i>chelys</i> to a kind of viol with eight strings. Numerous
representations of the <i>chelys</i> lyre or <i>testudo</i> occur on the Greek
vases, in which the actual tortoiseshell is depicted; a good illustration
is given in <i>Le Antichità, di Ercolano</i> (vol. i. pl. 43). Propertius
(iv. 6) calls the instrument the <i>lyra testudinea</i>. Scaliger
(on Manilius, <i>Astronomicon</i>, Proleg. 420) was probably the first
writer to draw attention to the difference, between <i>chelys</i> and

<p><span class="bold">CHEMICAL ACTION<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span>, the term given to any process in which
change in chemical composition occurs. Such processes may be
set up by the application of some form of energy (heat, light,
electricity, &amp;c.) to a substance, or by the mixing of two or more
substances together. If two or more substances be mixed one of
three things may occur. First, the particles may be mechanically
intermingled, the degree of association being dependent
upon the fineness of the particles, &amp;c. Secondly, the substances
may intermolecularly penetrate, as in the case of gas-mixtures
and solutions. Or thirdly they may react chemically. The
question whether, in any given case, we have to deal with a
physical mixture or a chemical compound is often decided by
the occurrence of very striking phenomena. To take a simple
example:&mdash;oxygen and hydrogen are two gases which may be
mixed in all proportions at ordinary temperatures, and it is easy
to show that the properties of the products are simply those of
mixtures of the two free gases. If, however, an electric spark
be passed through the mixtures, powerful chemical union ensues,
with its concomitants, great evolution of heat and consequent
rise of temperature, and a compound, water, is formed which
presents physical and chemical properties entirely different from
those of its constituents.</p>

<p>In general, powerful chemical forces give rise to the evolution
of large quantities of heat, and the properties of the resulting substance
differ vastly more from those of its components than is the
case with simple mixtures. This constitutes a valuable criterion
as to whether mere mixture is involved on the one hand, or strong
chemical union on the other. When, however, the chemical
forces are weak and the reaction, being incomplete, leads to a
state of chemical equilibrium, in which all the reacting substances
are present side by side, this criterion vanishes. For example, the
question whether a salt combines with water molecules when
dissolved in water cannot be said even yet to be fully settled,
and, although there can be no doubt that solution is, in many
cases, attended by chemical processes, still we possess as yet no
means of deciding, with certainty, how many molecules of
water have bound themselves to a single molecule of the dissolved
substance (<i>solute</i>). On the other hand, we possess exact methods
of testing whether gases or solutes in dilute solution react one
with another and of determining the equilibrium state which is
attained. For if one solute react with another on adding the
latter to its solution, then corresponding to the decrease of its
concentration there must also be a decrease of vapour pressure,
and of solubility in other solvents; further, in the case of a
mixture of gases, the concentration of each single constituent
follows from its solubility in some suitable solvent. We thus
obtain the answer to the question: whether the concentration
of a certain constituent has decreased during mixing, <i>i.e.</i> whether
it has reacted chemically.</p>

<p>When a compound can be obtained in a pure state, analysis
affords us an important criterion of its chemical nature, for
unlike mixtures, the compositions of which are always variable
within wider or narrower limits, chemical compounds present
definite and characteristic mass-relations, which find full expression
in the atomic theory propounded by Dalton (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Atom</a></span>).
According to this theory a mixture is the result of the mutual
interpenetration of the molecules of substances, which remain
unchanged as such, whilst chemical union involves changes more
deeply seated, inasmuch as new molecular species appear.
These new substances, if well-defined chemical compounds, have
a perfectly definite composition and contain a definite, generally
small, number of elementary atoms, and therefore the law of
constant proportions follows at once, and the fact that only an
integral number of atoms of any element may enter into the
composition of any molecule determines the law of multiple
proportions.</p>

<p>These considerations bring us face to face with the task of
more closely investigating the nature of chemical
forces, in other words, of answering the question:
<span class="sidenote">Nature of chemical forces.</span>
what forces guide the atoms in the formation of a new
molecular species? This problem is still far from
being completely answered, so that a few general remarks must
suffice here.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that among the most stable chemical compounds,
we find combinations of atoms of one and the same
element. Thus, the stability of the di-atomic molecule N<span class="su">2</span> is
so great, that no trace of dissociation has yet been proved even
at the highest temperatures, and as the constituent atoms of the
molecule N<span class="su">2</span> must be regarded as absolutely identical, it is clear
that &ldquo;polar&rdquo; forces cannot be the cause of all chemical action.
On the other hand, especially powerful affinities are also
at work when so-called electro-positive and electro-negative
elements react. The forces which here come into play appear to
be considerably greater than those just mentioned; for instance,
potassium fluoride is perhaps the most stable of all known
compounds.</p>

<p>It is also to be noticed that the combinations of the electro-negative
elements (metalloids) with one another exhibit a
metalloid character, and also we find, in the mutual combinations
of metals, all the characteristics of the metallic state; but in
the formation of a <i>salt</i> from a metal and a metalloid we have an
entirely new substance, quite different from its components;
and at the same time, the product is seen to be an electrolyte,
i.e. to have the power of splitting up into a positively and a
negatively charged constituent when dissolved in some solvent.
These considerations lead to the conviction that forces of a
&ldquo;polar&rdquo; origin play an important part here, and indeed we may
make the general surmise that in the act of chemical combination
forces of both a non-polar and polar nature play a part, and that
the latter are in all probability identical with the electric forces.</p>

<p>It now remains to be asked&mdash;what are the laws which govern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
the action of these forces? This question is of fundamental
importance, since it leads directly to those laws which regulate
the chemical process. Besides the already mentioned fundamental
law of chemical combination, that of constant and
multiple proportions, there is the law of chemical mass-action,
discovered by Guldberg and Waage in 1867, which we will now
develop from a kinetic standpoint.</p>

<p><i>Kinetic Basis of the Law of Chemical Mass-action.</i>&mdash;We will
assume that the molecular species A<span class="su">1</span>, A<span class="su">2</span>, ... A&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, A&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, ...
are present in a homogeneous system, where they can react on
each other only according to the scheme</p>

<p class="center1">A<span class="su">1</span> + A<span class="su">2</span> + ... &harr; A&prime;<span class="su">1</span> + A&prime;<span class="su">2</span> + ...;</p>

<p class="noind">this is a special case of the general equation</p>

<p class="center1">n<span class="su">1</span>A<span class="su">1</span> + n<span class="su">2</span>A<span class="su">2</span> + ... &harr; n&prime;<span class="su">1</span>A&prime;<span class="su">1</span> + n&prime;<span class="su">2</span>A&prime;<span class="su">2</span> + ...,</p>

<p class="noind">in which only one molecule of each substance takes part in the
reaction. The reacting substances may be either gaseous or
form a liquid mixture, or be dissolved in some selected solvent;
but in each case we may state the following considerations
regarding the course of the reaction. For a transformation to
take place from left to right in the sense of the reaction equation,
all the molecules A<span class="su">1</span>, A<span class="su">2</span>, ... must clearly collide at one point;
otherwise no reaction is possible, since we shall not consider
side-reactions. Such a collision need not of course bring about
that transposition of the atoms of the single molecules which
constitutes the above reaction. Much rather must it be of such
a kind as is favourable to that loosening of the bonds that bind
the atoms in the separate molecules, which must precede this
transposition. Of a large number of such collisions, therefore,
only a certain smaller number will involve a transposition from
left to right in the sense of the equation. But this number will
be the same under the same external conditions, and the greater
the more numerous the collisions; in fact a direct ratio must
exist between the two. Bearing in mind now, that the number
of collisions must be proportional to each of the concentrations
of the bodies A<span class="su">1</span>, A<span class="su">2</span>, ...,  and therefore, on the whole, to the
product of all these concentrations, we arrive at the conclusion
that the velocity v of the transposition from left to right in the
sense of the reaction equation is v = kc<span class="su">1</span>c<span class="su">2</span> ..., in which c<span class="su">1</span>, c<span class="su">2</span>,
... represent the spatial concentrations, <i>i.e.</i> the number of
gram-molecules of the substances A<span class="su">1</span>, A<span class="su">2</span>, ... present in one
litre, and k is, at a given temperature, a constant which may be
called the velocity-coefficient.</p>

<p>Exactly the same consideration applies to the molecules
A&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, A&prime;<span class="su">2</span>.... Here the velocity of the change from right to
left in the sense of the reaction-equation increases with the
number of collisions of all these molecules at one point, and this
is proportional to the product of all the concentrations. If
k&rsquo; denotes the corresponding proportionality-factor, then the
velocity v&rsquo; of the change from right to left in the sense of the
reaction-equation is v&prime; = k&prime;c&prime;<span class="su">1</span>c&prime;<span class="su">2</span>.... These spatial concentrations
are often called the &ldquo;active masses&rdquo; of the reacting components.
Hence the reaction-velocity in the sense of the reaction-equation
from left to right, or the reverse, is proportional to the
product of the &ldquo;active-masses&rdquo; of the left-hand or right-hand
components respectively.</p>

<p>Neither v nor v&prime; can be separately investigated, and the
measurements of the course of a reaction always furnish only
the difference of these two quantities. The reaction-velocity
<span class="sidenote">Law of chemical statics.</span>
actually observed represents the difference
of these two partial reaction-velocities, whilst the
amount of change observed during any period of time
is equal to the change in the one direction, minus the change in
the opposite direction. It must not be assumed, however, that
on the attainment of equilibrium all action has ceased, but
rather that the velocity of change in one direction has become
equal to that in the opposite direction, with the result that no
further total change can be observed, <i>i.e.</i> the system has reached
equilibrium, for which the relation v - v&prime; = 0 must therefore hold,
or what is the same thing</p>

<p class="center1">kc<span class="su">1</span>c<span class="su">2</span> ... = k&rsquo;c&rsquo;<span class="su">1</span>c&rsquo;<span class="su">2</span> ...,</p>

<p class="noind">this is the fundamental law of chemical statics.</p>

<p>The conception that the equilibrium is not to be attributed
to absolute indifference between the reacting bodies, but that
these continue to exert their mutual actions undiminished and
the opposing changes now balance, is of fundamental significance
in the interpretation of changes of matter in general. This is
generally expressed in the form: <i>the equilibrium in this and
other analogous cases is not static but dynamic.</i> This conception
was a direct result of the kinetic-molecular considerations, and
was applied with special success to the development of the kinetic
theory of gases. Thus with Clausius, we conceive the equilibrium
of water-vapour with water, not as if neither water vaporized
nor vapour condensed, but rather as though the two processes
went on unhindered in the equilibrium state, <i>i.e.</i> during contact
of saturated vapour with water, in a given time, as many water
molecules passed through the water surface in one direction as
in the opposite direction. This view, as applied to chemical
changes, was first advanced by A.W. Williamson (1851), and
further developed by C.M. Guldberg and P. Waage and
others.</p>

<p>From the previous considerations it follows that the reaction-velocity
at every moment, <i>i.e.</i> the velocity with
which the chemical process advances towards the
<span class="sidenote">Law of chemical kinetics.</span>
equilibrium state, is given by the equation</p>

<p class="center1">V = v - v&prime; = kc<span class="su">1</span>c<span class="su">2</span> ... - k&prime;c&prime;<span class="su">1</span>c&prime;<span class="su">2</span> ...;</p>

<p class="noind">this states the fundamental law of chemical kinetics.</p>

<p>The equilibrium equation is simply a special case of this more
general one, and results when the total velocity is written
zero, just as in analytical mechanics the equilibrium conditions
follow at once by specialization of the general equations of motion.</p>

<p>No difficulty presents itself in the generalization of the previous
equations for the reaction which proceeds after the scheme</p>

<p class="center1">n<span class="su">1</span>A<span class="su">1</span> + n<span class="su">2</span>A<span class="su">2</span> + ... = n&prime;<span class="su">1</span>A&prime;<span class="su">1</span> + n&prime;<span class="su">2</span>A&prime;<span class="su">2</span> + ...,</p>

<p class="noind">where n<span class="su">1</span>, n<span class="su">2</span>, ..., n&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, n&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, ... denote the numbers of molecules
of the separate substances which take part in the reaction, and
are therefore whole, mostly small, numbers (generally one or
two, seldom three or more). Here as before, v and v&prime; are to be
regarded as proportional to the number of collisions at one point
of all molecules necessary to the respective reaction, but now n<span class="su">1</span>
molecules of A<span class="su">1</span>, n<span class="su">2</span> molecules of A<span class="su">2</span>, &amp;c., must collide for the
reaction to advance from left to right in the sense of the equation;
and similarly n&prime;<span class="su">1</span> molecules of A&prime;<span class="su">1</span>, n&prime;<span class="su">2</span> molecules of A&prime;<span class="su">2</span>, &amp;c.,
must collide for the reaction to proceed in the opposite direction.
If we consider the path of a single, arbitrarily chosen molecule
over a certain time, then the number of its collisions with other
similar molecules will be proportional to the concentration C
of that kind of molecule to which it belongs. The number of
encounters between two molecules of the kind in question, during
the same time, will be in general C times as many, <i>i.e.</i> the number
of encounters of two of the same molecules is proportional to
the square of the concentration C; and generally, the number
of encounters of n molecules of one kind must be regarded as
proportional to the nth power of C, <i>i.e.</i> C<span class="sp">n</span>.</p>

<p>The number of collisions of n<span class="su">1</span> molecules of A<span class="su">1</span>, n<span class="su">2</span> molecules
of A<span class="su">2</span> ... is accordingly proportional to C<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">n1</span>C<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">n2</span> ..., and the
reaction-velocity corresponding to it is therefore</p>

<p class="center1">v = kC<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">n1</span>C<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">n2</span> ...,</p>

<p class="noind">and similarly the opposed reaction-velocity is</p>

<p class="center1">v&prime; = k&prime;C&prime;<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">n&prime;1</span>C&prime;<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">n&prime;2</span> ...;</p>

<p class="noind">the resultant reaction-velocity, being the difference of these
two partial velocities, is therefore</p>

<p class="center1">V = v - v&prime; = kC<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">n1</span>C<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">n2</span> ... - k&prime;C&prime;<span class="su">1</span><span class="sp">n&prime;1</span>C&prime;<span class="su">2</span><span class="sp">n&prime;2</span> ...</p>

<p class="noind">This is the most general expression of the law of chemical mass-action,
for the case of homogeneous systems.</p>

<p>Equating V to zero, we obtain the equation for the equilibrium
state, viz.</p>

assume the system to be homogeneous, <i>i.e.</i> to be either a homogeneous
gas-mixture or a homogeneous dilute solution.
<span class="sidenote">Limitations and applications of the laws.</span>
The case in which other states of matter share in the
equilibrium permits of simple treatment when the
substances in question may be regarded as pure, and
consequently as possessing definite vapour-pressures
or solubilities at a given temperature. In this case the molecular
species in question, which is, at the same time, present in excess
and is hence usually, called a <i>Bodenkörper</i>, must possess a constant
concentration in the gas-space or solution. But since the left-hand
side of the last equation contains only variable quantities,
it is simplest and most convenient to absorb these constant
concentrations into the equilibrium-constant; whence we have
the rule: leave the molecular species present as <i>Bodenkörper</i>
out of account, when determining the concentration-product.
Guldberg and Waage expressed this in the form &ldquo;the active
mass of a solid substance is constant.&rdquo; The same is true of
liquids when these participate in the pure state in the equilibrium,
and possess therefore a definite vapour-pressure or solubility.
When, finally, we are not dealing with a dilute solution but with
any kind of mixture whatever, it is simplest to apply the law
of mass-action to the gaseous mixture in equilibrium with this.
The composition of the liquid mixture is then determinable
when the vapour-pressures of the separate components are
known. This, however, is not often the case; but in principle
this consideration is important, since it involves the possibility
of extending the law of chemical mass-action from ideal gas-mixtures
and dilute solutions, for which it primarily holds, to
any other system whatever.</p>

<p>The more recent development of theoretical chemistry, as
well as the detailed study of many chemical processes which
have found technical application, leads more and more convincingly
to the recognition that in the law of chemical mass-action
we have a law of as fundamental significance as the law
of constant and multiple proportions. It is therefore not without
interest to briefly touch upon the development of the doctrine
of chemical affinity.</p>

<p><i>Historical Development of the Law of Mass-action.</i>&mdash;The theory
developed by Torbern Olof Bergman in 1775 must be regarded
as the first attempt of importance to account for the mode of
action of chemical forces. The essential principle of this may
be stated as follows:&mdash;The magnitude of chemical affinity may
be expressed by a definite number; if the affinity of the substance
A is greater for the substance B than for the substance
C, then the latter (C) will be completely expelled by B from its
compound with A, in the sense of the equation A·C + B = A·B + C.
This theory fails, however, to take account of the influence of
the relative masses of the reacting substances, and had to be
abandoned as soon as such an influence was noticed. An
attempt to consider this factor was made by Claude Louis
Berthollet (1801), who introduced the conception of chemical
equilibrium. The views of this French chemist may be summed
up in the following sentence:&mdash;Different substances have different
affinities for each other, which only come into play on immediate
contact. The condition of equilibrium depends not only
upon the chemical affinity, but also essentially upon the relative
masses of the reacting substances.</p>

<p>Essentially, Berthollet&rsquo;s idea is to-day the guiding principle
of the doctrine of affinity. This is especially true of our conceptions
of many reactions which, in the sense of Bergman&rsquo;s idea,
proceed to completion, <i>i.e.</i> until the reacting substances are all
used up; but only for this reason, viz. that one or more of the
products of the reaction is removed from the reaction mixture
(either by crystallization, evaporation or some other process),
and hence the reverse reaction becomes impossible. Following
Berthollet&rsquo;s idea, two Norwegian investigators, C.M. Guldberg
and Peter Waage, succeeded in formulating the influence of the
reacting masses in a simple law&mdash;the law of chemical mass-action
already defined. The results of their theoretical and experimental
studies were published at Christiania in 1867 (<i>Études sur
les affinités chimiques</i>); this work marks a new epoch in the
history of chemistry. Even before this, formulae to describe the
progress of certain chemical reactions, which must be regarded
as applications of the law of mass-action, had been put forward
by Ludwig Wilhelmy (1850), and by A.G. Vernon-Harcourt
and William Esson (1856), but the service of Guldberg and
Waage in having grasped the law in its full significance and
logically applied it in all directions, remains of course undiminished.
Their treatise remained quite unknown; and so
it happened that John Hewitt Jellett (1873), J.H. van&rsquo;t Hoff
(1877), and others independently developed the same law.
The thermodynamic basis of the law of mass-action is primarily
due to Horstmann, J. Willard Gibbs and van&rsquo;t Hoff.</p>

<p><i>Applications.</i>&mdash;Let us consider, as an example of the application
of the law of mass-action, the case of the dissociation of
water-vapour, which takes place at high temperatures in the
sense of the equation 2H<span class="su">2</span>O = 2H<span class="su">2</span> + O<span class="su">2</span>. Representing the concentrations
of the corresponding molecular species by [H<span class="su">2</span>], &amp;c.,
the expression [H<span class="su">2</span>]² [O<span class="su">2</span>] / [H<span class="su">2</span>O]² must be constant at any given
temperature. This shows that the dissociation is set back by
increasing the pressure; for if the concentrations of all three
kinds of molecules be increased by strong compression, say to
ten times the former amounts, then the numerator is increased
one thousand, the denominator only one hundred times. Hence
if the original equilibrium-constant is to hold, the dissociation
must go back, and, what is more, by an exactly determinable
amount. At 2000° C. water-vapour is only dissociated to the
extent of a few per cent; therefore, even when only a small
excess of oxygen or hydrogen be present, the numerator in the
foregoing expression is much increased, and it is obvious that in
order to restore the equilibrium state, the concentration of the
other component, hydrogen or oxygen as the case may be, must
diminish. In the case of slightly dissociated substances, therefore,
even a relatively small excess of one component is sufficient
to set back the dissociation substantially.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Kinetics.</i>&mdash;It has been already mentioned that the
law of chemical mass-action not only defines the conditions for
chemical equilibrium, but contains at the same time the principles
of chemical kinetics. The previous considerations show
indeed that the actual progress of the reaction is determined by
the difference of the reaction-velocities in the one and the other
(opposed) direction, in the sense of the corresponding reaction-equation.
Since the reaction-velocity is given by the amount of
chemical change in a small interval of time, the law of chemical
mass-action supplies a differential equation, which, when integrated,
provides formulae which, as numerous experiments
have shown, very happily summarize the course of the reaction.
For the simplest case, in which a single species of molecule undergoes
almost complete decomposition, so that the reaction-velocity
in the reverse direction may be neglected, we have the
simple equation</p>

<p class="center1">dx/dt = k(a-x)</p>

<p class="noind">and if x = 0 when t = 0 we have by integration</p>

<p class="center1">k = t<span class="sp">-1</span> log {a / (a-x) }.</p>

<p>We will now apply these conclusions to the theory of the
ignition of an explosive gas-mixture, and in particular to the
combustion of &ldquo;knallgas&rdquo; (a mixture of hydrogen
<span class="sidenote">Theory of explosive combustion.</span>
and oxygen) to water-vapour. At ordinary temperatures
knallgas undergoes practically no change, and
it might be supposed that the two gases, oxygen and
hydrogen, have no affinity for each other. This conclusion,
however, is shown to be incorrect by the observation that it is
only necessary to add some suitable catalyst such as platinum-black
in order to immediately start the reaction. We must
therefore conclude that even at ordinary temperatures strong
chemical affinity is exerted between oxygen and hydrogen, but
that at low temperatures this encounters great frictional resistances,
or in other words that the reaction-velocity is very small.
It is a matter of general experience that the resistances which
the chemical forces have to overcome diminish with rising
temperature, <i>i.e.</i> the reaction-velocity increases with temperature.
Therefore, when we warm the knallgas, the number of collisions
of oxygen and hydrogen molecules favourable to the formation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>29</span>
of water becomes greater and greater, until at about 500° the
gradual formation of water is observed, while at still higher
temperatures the reaction-velocity becomes enormous. We
are now in a position to understand what is the result of a strong
local heating of the knallgas, as, for example, by an electric spark.
The strongly heated parts of the knallgas combine to form
water-vapour with great velocity and the evolution of large
amounts of heat, whereby the adjacent parts are brought to a
high temperature and into a state of rapid reaction, <i>i.e.</i> we
observe an ignition of the whole mixture. If we suppose the
knallgas to be at a very high temperature, then its combustion
will be no longer complete owing to the dissociation of water-vapour,
whilst at extremely high temperatures it would practically
disappear. Hence it is clear that knallgas appears to be
stable at low temperatures only because the reaction-velocity
is very small, but that at very high temperatures it is really
stable, since no chemical forces are then active, or, in other
words, the chemical affinity is very small.</p>

<p>The determination of the question whether the failure of
some reaction is due to an inappreciable reaction-velocity or to
absence of chemical affinity, is of fundamental importance, and
only in the first case can the reaction be hastened by catalysts.</p>

<p>Many chemical compounds behave like knallgas. Acetylene
is stable at ordinary temperatures, inasmuch as it only decomposes
slowly; but at the same time it is explosive, for the
decomposition when once started is rapidly propagated, on
account of the heat evolved by the splitting up of the gas into
carbon and hydrogen. At very high temperatures, however,
acetylene acquires real stability, since carbon and hydrogen
then react to form acetylene.</p>

<p>Many researches have shown that the combustion of an
inflammable gas-mixture which is started at a point, <i>e.g.</i> by an
electric spark, may be propagated in two essentially
<span class="sidenote">Explosion-waves.</span>
different ways. The characteristic of the slower
combustion consists in this, viz. that the high temperature
of the previously ignited layer spreads by conduction,
thereby bringing the adjacent layers to the ignition-temperature;
the velocity of the propagation is therefore conditioned in the
first place by the magnitude of the conductivity for heat, and
more particularly, in the second place, by the velocity with
which a moderately heated layer begins to react chemically,
and so to rise gradually in temperature, <i>i.e.</i> essentially by the
change of reaction-velocity with temperature. A second
entirely independent mode of propagation of the combustion
lies at the basis of the phenomenon that an explosive gas-mixture
can be ignited by strong compression or&mdash;more correctly&mdash;by
the rise of temperature thereby produced. The increase of the
concentrations of the reacting substances consequent upon this
increase of pressure raises the reaction-velocity in accordance
with the law of chemical mass-action, and so enormously favours
the rapid evolution of the heat of combustion.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that such a powerful compression-wave
can not only initiate the combustion, but also propagate it with
extremely high velocity. Indeed a compression-wave of this
kind passes through the gas-mixture, heated by the combustion
to a very high temperature. It must, however, be propagated
considerably faster than an ordinary compression-wave, for
the result of ignition in the compressed (still unburnt) layer is
the production of a very high pressure, which must in accordance
with the principles of wave-motion increase the velocity of
propagation. The absolute velocity of the explosion-wave
would seem, in the light of these considerations, to be susceptible
of accurate calculation. It is at least clear that it must be
considerably higher than the velocity of sound in the mass of
gas strongly heated by the explosion, and this is confirmed by
actual measurements (see below) which show that the velocity
of the explosion-wave is from one and a half times to double
that of sound-waves at the combustion temperature.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to form the following picture of the
processes which follow upon the ignition of a combustible gas-mixture
contained in a long tube. First we have the condition
of slow combustion; the heat is conveyed by conduction to the
adjacent layers, and there follows a velocity of propagation of
a few metres per second. But since the combustion is accompanied
by a high increase of pressure, the adjacent, still unburnt
layers are simultaneously compressed, whereby the reaction-velocity
increases, and the ignition proceeds faster. This
involves still greater compression of the next layers, and so if
the mixture be capable of sufficiently rapid combustion, the
velocity of propagation of the ignition must continually increase.
As soon as the compression in the still unburnt layers becomes
so great that spontaneous ignition results, the now much
more pronounced compression-waves excited with simultaneous
combustion must be propagated with very great velocity, i.e.
we have spontaneous development of an &ldquo;explosion-wave.&rdquo;
M.P.E. Berthelot, who discovered the presence of such explosion-waves,
proved their velocity of propagation to be independent
of the pressure, the cross-section of the tubes in which the
explosive gas-mixture is contained, as well as of the material
of which these are made, and concluded that this velocity is a
constant, characteristic of the particular mixture. The determination
of this velocity is naturally of the highest interest.</p>

<p>In the following table Berthelot&rsquo;s results are given along with
the later (1891) concordant ones of H.B. Dixon, the velocities
of propagation of explosions being given in metres per second.</p>

<p>The maximum pressure of the explosion-wave possesses very
high values; it appears that a compression of from 1 to 30-40
atmospheres is necessary to produce spontaneous ignition of
mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen. But since the heat evolved
in the path of the explosion causes a rise of temperature of
2000°-3000°, <i>i.e.</i> a rise of absolute temperature about four
times that directly following upon the initial compression, we are
here concerned with pressures amounting to considerably more
than 100 atmospheres. Both the magnitude of this pressure
and the circumstance that it so suddenly arises are peculiar to
the very powerful forces which distinguish the explosion-wave
from the slow combustion-wave.</p>

<p><i>Nascent State.</i>&mdash;The great reactive power of freshly formed
or nascent substances (<i>status nascens</i>)may be very simply
referred to the principles of mass-action. As is well known,
this phenomenon is specially striking in the case of hydrogen,
which may therefore be taken as a typical example. The law
of mass-action affirms the action of a substance to be the greater
the higher its concentration, or, for a gas, the higher its partial-pressure.
Now experience teaches that those metals which
liberate hydrogen from acids are able to supply the latter under
extremely high pressure, and we may therefore assume that the
hydrogen which results, for example, from the action of zinc
upon sulphuric acid is initially under very high pressures which
are then afterwards relieved. Hence the hydrogen during
liberation exhibits much more active powers of reduction than
the ordinary gas.</p>

<p>A deeper insight into the relations prevailing here is offered
from the atomistic point of view. From this we are bound to
conclude that the hydrogen is in the first instance evolved in
the form of free atoms, and since the velocity of the reaction
H + H = H<span class="su">2</span> at ordinary temperatures, though doubtless very
great, is not practically instantaneous, the freshly generated
hydrogen will contain a remnant of free atoms, which are able to
react both more actively and more rapidly. Similar considerations
are of course applicable to other cases.</p>

<p><i>Ion-reactions.</i>&mdash;The application of the law of chemical mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
action is much simplified in the case in which the reaction-velocity
is enormously great, when practically an instantaneous
adjustment of the equilibrium results. Only in this case can the
state of the system, which pertains after mixing the different
components, be determined merely from knowledge of the
equilibrium-constant. This case is realized in the reactions
between gases at very high temperatures, which have, however,
been little investigated, and especially by the reactions between
electrolytes, the so-called ion-reactions. In this latter case,
which has been thoroughly studied on account of its fundamental
importance for inorganic qualitative and quantitative analysis,
the degrees of dissociation of the various electrolytes (acids,
bases and salts) are for the most part easily determined by the
aid of the freezing-point apparatus, or of measurements of the
electric conductivity; and from these data the equilibrium-constant
K may be calculated. Moreover, it can be shown
that the state of the system can be determined when the equilibrium
constants of all the electrolytes which are present in the
common solution are known. If this be coupled with the law
that the solubility of solid substances, as with vapour-pressures,
is independent of the presence of other electrolytes, it is sufficient
to know the solubilities of the electrolytes in question, in order
to be able to determine which substances must participate in the
equilibrium in the solid state, <i>i.e.</i> we arrive at the theory of the
formation and solution of precipitates.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the application of these principles, we
shall deal with a problem of the doctrine of affinity, namely,
that of the relative strengths of acids and bases. It
<span class="sidenote">Strength of acids and bases.</span>
was quite an early and often repeated observation
that the various acids and bases take part with very
varying intensity or avidity in those reactions in
which their acid or basic nature comes into play. No success
attended the early attempts at giving numerical expression to
the strengths of acids and bases, <i>i.e.</i> of finding a numerical
coefficient for each acid and base, which should be the quantitative
expression of the degree of its participation in those specific
reactions characteristic of acids and bases respectively. Julius
Thomsen and W. Ostwald attacked the problem in a far-seeing
and comprehensive manner, and arrived at indisputable proof
that the property of acids and bases of exerting their effects
according to definite numerical coefficients finds expression not
only in salt-formation but also in a large number of other, and
indeed very miscellaneous, reactions.</p>

<p>When Ostwald compared the order of the strengths of acids
deduced from their competition for the same base, as determined
by Thomsen&rsquo;s thermo-chemical or his own volumetric method,
with that order in which the acids arrange themselves according
to their capacity to bring calcium oxalate into solution, or to
convert acetamide into ammonium acetate, or to split up
methyl acetate into methyl alcohol and acetic acid catalytically,
or to invert cane-sugar, or to accelerate the mutual action of
hydriodic on bromic acid, he found that in all these well-investigated
and very miscellaneous cases the same succession of acids
in the order of their strengths is obtained, whichever one of the
above chemical processes be chosen as measure of these strengths.
It is to be noticed that all these chemical changes cited took
place in dilute aqueous solution, consequently the above order
of acids refers only to the power to react under these circumstances.
The order of acids proved to be fairly independent
of temperature. While therefore the above investigations
afforded a definite qualitative solution of the order of acids
according to strengths, the determination of the quantitative
relations offered great difficulties, and the numerical coefficients,
determined from the separate reactions, often displayed great
variations, though occasionally also surprising agreement.
Especially great were the variations of the coefficients with the
concentration, and in those cases in which the concentration
of the acid changed considerably during the reaction, the calculation
was naturally quite uncertain. Similar relations were
found in the investigation of bases, the scope of which, however,
was much more limited.</p>

<p>These apparently rather complicated relations were now
cleared up at one stroke, by the application of the law of chemical
mass-action on the lines indicated by S. Arrhenius in 1887, when
he put forward the theory of electrolytic dissociation to explain
that peculiar behaviour of substances in aqueous solution first
recognized by van&rsquo;t Hoff in 1885. The formulae which must
be made use of here in the calculation of the equilibrium-relations
follow naturally by simple application of the law of mass-action
to the corresponding ion-concentrations.</p>

<p>The peculiarities which the behaviour of acids and bases
presents, and, according to the theory of Arrhenius, must
present&mdash;peculiarities which found expression in the very early
distinction between neutral solutions on the one hand, and acid
or basic ones on the other, as well as in the belief in a polar
antithesis between the two last&mdash;must now, in the light of the
theory of electrolytic dissociation, be conceived as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The reactions characteristic of acids in aqueous solution,
which are common to and can only be brought about by acids,
find their explanation in the fact that this class of bodies gives
rise on dissociation to a common molecular species, namely, the
positively charged hydrogen-ion (H<span class="sp">+</span>). The specific chemical
actions peculiar to acids are therefore to be attributed to the
hydrogen-ion just as the actions common to all chlorides are to
be regarded as those of the free chlorine-ions. In like manner,
the reactions characteristic of bases in solution are to be attributed
to the negatively charged hydroxyl-ions (OH<span class="sp">-</span>), which
result from the dissociation of this class of bodies.</p>

<p>A solution has an acid reaction when it contains an excess of
hydrogen-ions, and a basic reaction when it contains an excess
of hydroxyl-ions. If an acid and an alkaline solution be brought
together mutual neutralization must result, since the positive
H-ions and the negative OH-ions cannot exist together in view
of the extremely weak conductivity of pure water and its consequent
slight electrolytic dissociation, and therefore they must at
once combine to form electrically neutral molecules, in the sense
of the equation</p>

<p class="center">H<span class="sp">+</span> + OH<span class="sp">-</span> = H<span class="su">2</span>O.</p>

<p class="noind">In this lies the simple explanation of the &ldquo;polar&rdquo; difference
between acid and basic solutions. This rests essentially upon the
fact that the ion peculiar to acids and the ion peculiar to bases
form the two constituents of water, <i>i.e.</i> of that solvent in which
we usually study the course of the reaction. The idea of the
&ldquo;strength&rdquo; of an acid or base at once arises. If we compare
equivalent solutions of various acids, the intensity of those
actions characteristic of them will be the greater the more free
hydrogen-ions they contain; this is an immediate consequence
of the law of chemical mass-action. The degree of electrolytic
dissociation determines, therefore, the strength of acids, and a
similar consideration leads to the same result for bases.</p>

<p>Now the degree of electrolytic dissociation changes with
concentration in a regular manner, which is given by the law of
mass-action. For if C denote the concentration of the electrolyte
and a its degree of dissociation, the above law states that</p>

<p class="center">C²a²/C(1-a) = Ca²/(1-a) = K.</p>

<p class="noind">At very great dilutions the dissociation is complete, and equivalent
solutions of the most various acids then contain the same
number of hydrogen-ions, or, in other words, are equally strong;
and the same is true of the hydroxyl-ions of bases. The dissociation
also decreases with increasing concentration, but at
different rates for different substances, and the relative
&ldquo;strengths&rdquo; of acids and bases must hence change with concentration,
as was indeed found experimentally. The dissociation-constant
K is the measure of the variation of the degree of
dissociation with concentration, and must therefore be regarded
as the measure of the strengths of acids and bases. So that in
this special case we are again brought to the result which was
stated in general terms above, viz. that the dissociation-coefficient
forms the measure of the reactivity of a dissolved electrolyte.
Ostwald&rsquo;s series of acids, based upon the investigation of the
most various reactions, should therefore correspond with the
order of their dissociation-constants, and further with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
order of their freezing-point depressions in equivalent solutions,
since the depression of the freezing-point increases with the
degree of electrolytic dissociation. Experience confirms this
conclusion completely. The degree of dissociation of an acid,
at a given concentration, for which its molecular conductivity
is &#923;, is shown by the theory of electrolytic dissociation to be
a = &#923; / &#923;<span class="su">&#8734;</span>; &#923;<span class="su">&#8734;</span>, the molecular conductivity at very great
dilution in accordance with the law of Kohlrausch, is u + v, where
u and v are the ionic-mobilities (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conduction</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electric</a></span>).
Since u, the ionic-mobility of the hydrogen ion, is generally
more than ten times as great as v, the ionic-mobility of the
negative acid-radical, &#923;<span class="su">&#8734;</span> has approximately the same value
(generally within less than 10%) for the different acids, and the
molecular-conductivity of the acids in equivalent concentration
is at least approximately proportional to the degree of electrolytic
dissociation, <i>i.e.</i> to the strength.</p>

<p>In general, therefore, the order of conductivities is identical
with that in which the acids exert their specific powers. This
remarkable parallelism, first perceived by Arrhenius and Ostwald
in 1885, was the happy development which led to the discovery
of electrolytic dissociation (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Conduction</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electric</a></span>; and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Solution</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Catalysis.</i>&mdash;We have already mentioned the fact, early known
to chemists, that many reactions proceed with a marked increase
of velocity in presence of many foreign substances. With
Berzelius we call this phenomenon &ldquo;catalysis,&rdquo; by which we
understand that general acceleration of reactions which also
progress when left to themselves, in the presence of certain
bodies which do not change in amount (or only slightly) during
the course of the reaction. Acids and bases appear to act
catalytically upon all reactions involving consumption or
liberation of water, and indeed that action is proportional to the
concentration of the hydrogen or hydroxyl-ions. Further, the
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is &ldquo;catalysed&rdquo; by iodine-ions,
the condensation of two molecules of benzaldehyde to
benzoin by cyanogen-ions. One of the earliest known and
technically most important instances of catalysis is that of the
oxidation of sulphur dioxide to sulphuric acid by oxygen in the
presence of oxides of nitrogen. Other well-known and remarkable
examples are the catalysis of the combustion of hydrogen
and of sulphur dioxide in oxygen by finely-divided platinum.
We may also mention the interesting work of Dixon and Baker,
which led to the discovery that a large number of gas-reactions,
<i>e.g.</i> the combustion of carbon monoxide, the dissociation of
sal-ammoniac vapour, and the action of sulphuretted hydrogen
upon the salts of heavy metals, cease when water-vapour is
absent, or at least proceed with greatly diminished velocity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Negative catalysis,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the retardation of a reaction by
addition of some substance, which is occasionally observed,
appears to depend upon the destruction of a &ldquo;positive catalyte&rdquo;
by the body added.</p>

<p>A catalyte can have no influence, however, upon the affinity
of a process, since that would be contrary to the second law of
thermodynamics, according to which affinity of an isothermal
process, which is measured by the maximum work, only depends
upon the initial and final states. The effect of a catalyte is
therefore limited to the resistances opposing the progress of a
reaction, and does not influence its driving-force or affinity.
Since the catalyte takes no part in the reaction its presence has
no effect on the equilibrium-constant. This, in accordance
with the law of mass-action, is the ratio of the separate
reaction-velocities in the two contrary directions. A catalyte must
therefore always accelerate the reverse-reaction. If the velocity
of formation of a body be increased by addition of some substance
then its velocity of decomposition must likewise increase. We
have an example of this in the well-known fact that the formation,
and no less the saponification, of esters, proceeds with increased
velocity in the presence of acids, while the observation that in
absence of water-vapour neither gaseous ammonium chloride
dissociates nor dry ammonia combines with hydrogen chloride
becomes clear on the same grounds.</p>

<p>A general theory of catalytic phenomena does not at present
exist. The formation of intermediate products by the action
of the reacting substance upon the catalyte has often been
thought to be the cause of these. These intervening products,
whose existence in many cases has been proved, then split up
into the catalyte and the reaction-product. Thus chemists
have sought to ascribe the influence of oxides of nitrogen on the
formation of sulphuric acid to the initial formation of nitrosyl-sulphuric
acid, SO<span class="su">2</span>(OH)(NO<span class="su">2</span>), from the mixture of sulphur
dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and air, which then reacted with water
to form sulphuric and nitrous acids. When the velocity of such
intermediate reactions is greater than that of the total change,
such an explanation may suffice, but a more certain proof of this
theory of catalysis has only been reached in a few cases, though
in many others it appears very plausible. Hence it is hardly
possible to interpret all catalytic processes on these lines.</p>

<p>In regard to catalysis in heterogeneous systems, especially
the hastening of gas-reactions by platinum, it is very probable
that it is closely connected with the solution or absorption of the
gases on the part of the metal. From the experiments of G.
Bredig it seems that colloidal solutions of a metal act like the
metal itself. The action of a colloidal-platinum solution on the
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is still sensible even at a
dilution of 1/70,000,000 grm.-mol. per litre; indeed the activity
of this colloidal-platinum solution calls to mind in many ways
that of organic ferments, hence Bredig has called it an &ldquo;inorganic
ferment.&rdquo; This analogy is especially striking in the change of
their activity with time and temperature, and in the possibility,
by means of bodies like sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrocyanic
acid, &amp;c., which act as strong poisons upon the latter, of &ldquo;poisoning&rdquo;
the former also, <i>i.e.</i> of rendering it inactive. In the case
of the catalytic action of water-vapour upon many processes
of combustion already mentioned, a part of the effect is probably
due to the circumstance, disclosed by numerous experiments,
that the union of hydrogen and oxygen proceeds,
between certain temperature limits at least, after the equation
H<span class="su">2</span> + O<span class="su">2</span> = H<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">2</span>, that is, with the preliminary formation of
hydrogen peroxide, which then breaks down into water and
oxygen, and further, above all, to the fact that this substance
results from oxygen and water at high temperatures with great
velocity, though indeed only in small quantities.</p>

<p>The view now suggests itself, that, for example, in the
combustion of carbon monoxide at moderately high temperatures,
the reaction</p>

<table style="width: 80%" summary="text format">
<tr><td class="tc5">(I.)</td>
    <td class="tc1m">2CO + O<span class="su">2</span> = 2CO<span class="su">2</span></td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">which together result in (I.), proceed rapidly even at moderate
temperatures.</p>

<p><i>Temperature and Reaction-Velocity.</i>&mdash;There are few natural
constants which undergo so marked a change with temperature
as those of the velocities of chemical changes. As a rule a rise
of temperature of 10° causes a twofold or threefold rise of
reaction-velocity.</p>

<p>If the reaction-coefficient  k, in the sense of the equation
derived above, viz.  k = t<span class="sp">-1</span> log {a / (a-x)}, be determined for the
inversion of cane-sugar by an acid of given concentration, the
following values are obtained:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="70%" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tc1m">Temperature</td>
    <td class="tc5">=</td><td class="tc5">25°</td><td class="tc5">40°</td><td class="tc5">45°</td><td class="tc5">50°</td><td class="tc5">55°</td></tr>

</table>

<p class="noind">here a rise of temperature of only 30° suffices to raise the speed of
inversion fifty times.</p>

<p>We possess no adequate explanation of this remarkable
temperature influence; but some account of it is given by the
molecular theory, according to which the energy of that motion
of substances in homogeneous gaseous or liquid systems which
constitutes heat increases with the temperature, and hence also
the frequency of collision of the reacting substances. When we
reflect that the velocity of motion of the molecules of gases, and
in all probability those of liquids also, are proportional to the
square root of the absolute temperature, and therefore rise by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
only 1/6% per degree at room-temperature, and that we must
assume the number of collisions proportional to the velocity of
the molecules, we cannot regard the actually observed increase
of reaction-velocity, which often amounts to 10 or 12% per degree,
as exclusively due to the quickening of the molecular motion by
heat. It is more probable that the increase of the kinetic energy
of the atomic motions within the molecule itself is of significance
here, as the rise of the specific heat of gases with temperature
seems to show. The change of the reaction-coefficient k with
temperature may be represented by the empirical equation
log k = -AT<span class="sp">-1</span> + B + CT, where A, B, C are positive constants.
For low temperatures the influence of the last term is as a
rule negligible, whilst for high temperatures the first term on the
right side plays a vanishingly small part.</p>

<p><i>Definition of Chemical Affinity.</i>&mdash;We have still to discuss the
question of what is to be regarded as the measure of chemical
affinity. Since we are not in a position to measure directly the
intensity of chemical forces, the idea suggests itself to determine
the strength of chemical affinity from the amount of the work
which the corresponding reaction is able to do. To a certain
extent the evolution of heat accompanying the reaction is a
measure of this work, and attempts have been made to measure
chemical affinities thermo-chemically, though it may be easily
shown that this definition was not well chosen. For when, as is
clearly most convenient, affinity is so defined that it determines
under all circumstances the direction of chemical change, the
above definition fails in so far as chemical processes often take
place with absorption of heat, that is, contrary to affinities so
defined. But even in those cases in which the course of the
reaction at first proceeds in the sense of the evolution of heat,
it is often observed that the reaction advances not to completion
but to a certain equilibrium, or, in other words, stops
before the evolution of heat is complete.</p>

<p>A definition free from this objection is supplied by the second
law of thermodynamics, in accordance with which all processes
must take place in so far as they are able to do external work.
When therefore we identify chemical affinity with the maximum
work which can be gained from the process in question, we reach
such a definition that the direction of the process is under all
conditions determined by the affinity. Further, this definition
has proved serviceable in so far as the maximum work in many
cases may be experimentally measured, and moreover it stands
in a simple relation to the equilibrium constant K.
Thermodynamics teaches that the maximum work A may be expressed
as A = RT log K, when R denotes the gas-constant, T the absolute
temperature. In this it is further assumed that both the molecular
species produced as well as those that disappear are present
in unit concentration. The simplest experimental method of
directly determining chemical affinity consists in the measurement
of electromotive force. The latter at once gives us the work
which can be gained when the corresponding galvanic element
supplies the electricity, and, since the chemical exchange of one
gram-equivalent from Faraday&rsquo;s law requires 96,540 coulombs,
we obtain from the product of this number and the electromotive
force the work per gram-equivalent in watt-seconds, and this
quantity when multiplied by O.23872 is obtained in terms of the
usual unit, the gram-calorie. Experience teaches that, especially
when we have to deal with strong affinities, the affinity so determined
is for the most part almost the same as the heat-evolution,
whilst in the case in which only solid or liquid substances in the
pure state take part in the reaction at low temperatures,
heat-evolution and affinity appear to possess a practically identical
value.</p>

<p>Hence it seems possible to calculate equilibria for low temperatures
from heats of reaction, by the aid of the two equations</p>

<p class="center1">A = Q, &nbsp;&nbsp;A = RT log K;</p>

<p class="noind">and since the change of A with temperature, as required by the
principles of thermodynamics, follows from the specific heats of
the reacting substances, it seems further possible to calculate
chemical equilibria from heats of reaction and specific heats.
The circumstance that chemical affinity and heat-evolution
so nearly coincide at low temperatures may be derived from the
hypothesis that chemical processes are the result of forces of
attraction between the atoms of the different elements. If we
may disregard the kinetic energy of the atoms, and this is
legitimate for low temperatures, it follows that both heat-evolution
and chemical affinity are merely equal to the decrease of the
potential energy of the above-mentioned forces, and it is at once
clear that the evolution of heat during a reaction between only
pure solid or pure liquid substances possesses special importance.</p>

<p>More complicated is the case in which gases or dissolved
substances take part. This is simplified if we first consider the
mixing of two mutually chemically indifferent gases. Thermodynamics
teaches that external work may be gained by the mere
mixing of two such gases (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Diffusion</a></span>), and these amounts of
work, which assume very considerable proportions at high
temperatures, naturally affect the value of the maximum work
and so also of the affinity, in that they always come into play
when gases or solutions react. While therefore we regard as
chemical affinity in the strictest sense the decrease of potential
energy of the forces acting between the atoms, it is clear that the
quantities here involved exhibit the simplest relations under the
experimental conditions just given, for when only substances
in a pure state take part in a reaction, all mixing of different
kinds of molecules is excluded; moreover, the circumstance
that the respective substances are considered at very low
temperatures reduces the quantities of energy absorbed as kinetic
energy by their molecules to the smallest possible amount.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Resistance.</i>&mdash;When we know the chemical affinity of
a reaction, we are in a position to decide in which direction the
process must advance, but, unless we know the reaction-velocity
also, we can in many cases say nothing as to whether or not the
reaction in question will progress with a practically inappreciable
velocity so that apparent chemical indifference is the result.
This question may be stated in the light of the law of mass-action
briefly as follows:&mdash;From a knowledge of the chemical
affinity we can calculate the equilibrium, <i>i.e.</i> the numerical
value of the constant K = k / k&prime;; but to be completely informed
of the process we must know not only the ratio of the two
velocity-constants k and k&prime;, but also the separate absolute values
of the same.</p>

<p>In many respects the following view is more comprehensive,
though naturally in harmony with the one just expressed.
Since the chemical equilibrium is periodically attained, it follows
that, as in the case of the motion of a body or of the diffusion of
a dissolved substance, it must be opposed by very great friction.
In all these cases the velocity of the process at every instant is
directly proportional to the driving-force and inversely proportional
to the frictional resistance. We hence arrive at the
result that an equation of the form</p>

<p class="center1"><i>reaction-velocity = chemical force/chemical resistance</i></p>

<p class="noind">must also hold for chemical change; here we have an analogy
with Ohm&rsquo;s law. The &ldquo;chemical force&rdquo; at every instant may
be calculated from the maximum work (affinity); as yet little
is known about &ldquo;chemical resistance,&rdquo; but it is not improbable
that it may be directly measured or theoretically deduced.
The problem of the calculation of chemical reaction-velocity in
absolute measure would then be solved; so far we possess indeed
only a few general facts concerning the magnitude of chemical
resistance. It is immeasurably small at ordinary temperatures
for ion-reactions, and, on the other hand, fairly large for nearly all
reactions in which carbon-bonds must be loosened (so-called
&ldquo;inertia of the carbon-bond&rdquo;) and possesses very high values
for most gas-reactions also. With rising temperature it always
strongly diminishes; on the other hand, at very low temperatures
its values are always enormous, and at the absolute zero
of temperature may be infinitely great. Therefore at that
temperature all reactions cease, since the denominator in the
above expression assumes enormous values.</p>

<p>It is a very remarkable phenomenon that the chemical resistance
is often small in the case of precisely those reactions in
which the affinity is also small; to this circumstance is to be
traced the fact that in many chemical changes the most stable
condition is not at once reached, but is preceded by the formation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
of more or less unstable intermediate products. Thus the unstable
ozone is very often first formed on the evolution of oxygen,
whilst in the reaction between oxygen and hydrogen water is
often not at once formed, but first the unstable hydrogen
peroxide as an intermediate product.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the chemical process in the light of the
equation</p>

<p class="center1"><i>reaction-velocity = chemical force/chemical resistance.</i></p>

<p class="noind">Thermodynamics shows that at very low temperatures, i.e.
in the immediate vicinity of the absolute zero, there is no
equilibrium, but every chemical process advances to completion
in the one or the other direction. The chemical forces therefore
act in the one direction towards complete consumption of the
reacting substance. But since the chemical resistance is now
immensely great, they can produce practically no appreciable
result.</p>

<p>At higher temperatures the reaction always proceeds, at least
in homogeneous systems, to a certain equilibrium, and as the
chemical resistance now has finite values this equilibrium will
always finally be reached after a longer or shorter time. Finally,
at very high temperatures the chemical resistance is in every case
very small, and the equilibrium is almost instantaneously
reached; at the same time, the affinity of the reaction, as in the
case of the mutual affinity between oxygen and hydrogen, may
very strongly diminish, and we have then chemical indifference
again, not because, as at low temperatures, the denominator
of the previous expression becomes very great, but because the
numerator now assumes vanishingly small values.</p>

see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alchemy</a></span>), the natural science which has for its province
the study of the composition of substances. In common
with physics it includes the determination of properties or
characters which serve to distinguish one substance from another,
but while the physicist is concerned with properties possessed by
all substances and with processes in which the molecules remain
intact, the chemist is restricted to those processes in which the
molecules undergo some change. For example, the physicist
determines the density, elasticity, hardness, electrical and
thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, &amp;c.; the chemist,
on the other hand, investigates changes in composition, such as
may be effected by an electric current, by heat, or when two or
more substances are mixed. A further differentiation of the
provinces of chemistry and physics is shown by the classifications
of matter. To the physicist matter is presented in three leading
forms&mdash;solids, liquids and gases; and although further subdivisions
have been rendered necessary with the growth of
knowledge the same principle is retained, namely, a classification
based on properties having no relation to composition. The
fundamental chemical classification of matter, on the other
hand, recognizes two groups of substances, namely, <i>elements</i>,
which are substances not admitting of analysis into other
substances, and <i>compounds</i>, which do admit of analysis into
simpler substances and also of synthesis from simpler substances.
Chemistry and physics, however, meet on common ground in
a well-defined branch of science, named physical chemistry,
which is primarily concerned with the correlation of physical
properties and chemical composition, and, more generally,
with the elucidation of natural phenomena on the molecular
theory.</p>

<p class="center1">I. <span class="sc">History</span></p>

<p>Although chemical actions must have been observed by man
in the most remote times, and also utilized in such processes
as the extraction of metals from their ores and in the arts of
tanning and dyeing, there is no evidence to show that, beyond
an unordered accumulation of facts, the early developments of
these industries were attended by any real knowledge of the
nature of the processes involved. All observations were the
result of accident or chance, or possibly in some cases of experimental
trial, but there is no record of a theory or even a general
classification of the phenomena involved, although there is no
doubt that the ancients had a fair knowledge of the properties
and uses of the commoner substances. The origin of chemistry
is intimately bound up with the arts which we have indicated;
in this respect it is essentially an experimental science. A
unifying principle of chemical and physical changes was provided
by metaphysical conceptions of the structure of matter.
We find the notion of &ldquo;elements,&rdquo; or primary qualities, which
confer upon all species of matter their distinctive qualities by
appropriate combination, and also the doctrine that
<span class="sidenote">Greek philosophy.</span>
matter is composed of minute discrete particles,
prevailing in the Greek schools. These &ldquo;elements,&rdquo;
however, had not the significance of the elements of
to-day; they connoted physical appearances or qualities rather
than chemical relations; and the atomic theory of the ancients
is a speculation based upon metaphysical considerations, having,
in its origin, nothing in common with the modern molecular
theory, which was based upon experimentally observed properties
of gases (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Element</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Molecule</a></span>).</p>

<p>Although such hypotheses could contribute nothing directly
to the development of a science which laid especial claim to
experimental investigations, yet indirectly they stimulated
inquiry into the nature of the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; with which the four
&ldquo;elements&rdquo; were associated. This <i>quinta essentia</i> had been
speculated upon by the Greeks, some regarding it as immaterial
or aethereal, and others as material; and a school of philosophers
termed alchemists arose who attempted the isolation of this
essence. The existence of a fundamental principle, unalterable
and indestructible, prevailing alike through physical and chemical
changes, was generally accepted. Any change which a substance
may chance to undergo was simply due to the discarding or
taking up of some proportion of the primary &ldquo;elements&rdquo; or
qualities: of these coverings &ldquo;water,&rdquo; &ldquo;air,&rdquo; &ldquo;earth&rdquo; and
&ldquo;fire&rdquo; were regarded as clinging most tenaciously to the essence,
while &ldquo;cold,&rdquo; &ldquo;heat,&rdquo; &ldquo;moistness&rdquo; and &ldquo;dryness&rdquo; were
more easily cast aside or assumed. Several origins have been
<span class="sidenote">Alchemy.</span>
suggested for the word alchemy, and there seems to
have been some doubt as to the exact nature and
import of the alchemical doctrines. According to M.P.E.
Berthelot, &ldquo;alchemy rested partly on the industrial processes
of the ancient Egyptians, partly on the speculative theories
of the Greek philosophers, and partly on the mystical reveries
of the Gnostics and Alexandrians.&rdquo; The search for this essence
subsequently resolved itself into the desire to effect the
transmutation of metals, more especially the base metals, into silver
and gold. It seems that this secondary principle became the
dominant idea in alchemy, and in this sense the word is used
in Byzantine literature of the 4th century; Suidas, writing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
the 11th century, defines chemistry as the &ldquo;preparation of
silver and gold&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alchemy</a></span>).</p>

<p>From the Alexandrians the science passed to the Arabs,
who made discoveries and improved various methods of separating
substances, and afterwards, from the 11th century, became
seated in Europe, where the alchemical doctrines were assiduously
studied until the 15th and 16th centuries. It is readily
understood why men imbued with the authority of tradition
should prosecute the search for a substance which would
confer unlimited wealth upon the fortunate discoverer. Some
alchemists honestly laboured to effect the transmutation and to
discover the &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s stone,&rdquo; and in many cases believed
that they had achieved success, if we may rely upon writings
assigned to them. The period, however, is one of literary
forgeries; most of the MSS. are of uncertain date and authorship,
and moreover are often so vague and mystical that they are of
doubtful scientific value, beyond reflecting the tendencies of
the age. The retaining of alchemists at various courts shows
the high opinion which the doctrines had gained. It is really
not extraordinary that Isaac Hollandus was able to indicate
the method of the preparation of the &ldquo;philosopher&rsquo;s stone&rdquo;
from &ldquo;adamic&rdquo; or &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; earth, and its action when medicinally
employed; that in the writings assigned to Roger Bacon,
Raimon Lull, Basil Valentine and others are to be found the
exact quantities of it to be used in transmutation; and that
George Ripley, in the 15th century, had grounds for regarding
its action as similar to that of a ferment.</p>

<p>In the view of some alchemists, the ultimate principles of
matter were Aristotle&rsquo;s four elements; the proximate constituents
were a &ldquo;sulphur&rdquo; and a &ldquo;mercury,&rdquo; the father and mother
of the metals; gold was supposed to have attained to the
perfection of its nature by passing in succession through the
forms of lead, brass and silver; gold and silver were held to
contain very pure red sulphur and white quicksilver, whereas
in the other metals these materials were coarser and of a different
colour. From an analogy instituted between the healthy human
being and gold, the most perfect of the metals, silver, mercury,
copper, iron, lead and tin, were regarded in the light of lepers
that required to be healed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the false idea which prompted the researches
of the alchemists, many advances were made in descriptive
chemistry, the metals and their salts receiving much
<span class="sidenote">Iatrochemistry.</span>
attention, and several of our important acids being
discovered. Towards the 16th century the failure
of the alchemists to achieve their cherished purpose, and the
general increase of medical knowledge, caused attention to be
given to the utilization of chemical preparations as medicines.
As early as the 15th century the alchemist Basil Valentine had
suggested this application, but the great exponent of this
doctrine was Paracelsus, who set up a new definition: &ldquo;The
true use of chemistry is not to make gold but to prepare medicines.&rdquo;
This relation of chemistry to medicine prevailed until
the 17th century, and what in the history of chemistry is termed
the iatrochemical period (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Medicine</a></span>) was mainly fruitful
in increasing the knowledge of compounds; the contributions
to chemical theory are of little value, the most important
controversies ranging over the nature of the &ldquo;elements,&rdquo; which were
generally akin to those of Aristotle, modified so as to be more
in accord with current observations. At the same time,
however, there were many who, opposed to the Paracelsian
definition of chemistry, still laboured at the problem of the
alchemists, while others gave much attention to the chemical
industries. Metallurgical operations, such as smelting, roasting
and refining, were scientifically investigated, and in some degree
explained, by Georg Agricola and Carlo Biringuiccio; ceramics
was studied by Bernard Palissy, who is also to be remembered as
an early worker in agricultural chemistry, having made experiments
on the effect of manures on soils and crops; while general
technical chemistry was enriched by Johann Rudolf Glauber.<a name="FnAnchor_1b" id="FnAnchor_1b" href="#Footnote_1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The second half of the 17th century witnessed remarkable
transitions and developments in all branches of natural science,
and the facts accumulated by preceding generations
<span class="sidenote">Boyle.</span>
during their generally unordered researches were replaced
by a co-ordination of experiment and deduction. From
the mazy and incoherent alchemical and iatrochemical doctrines,
the former based on false conceptions of matter, the latter on
erroneous views of life processes and physiology, a new science
arose&mdash;the study of the composition of substances. The formulation
of this definition of chemistry was due to Robert Boyle.
In his <i>Sceptical Chemist</i> (1662) he freely criticized the prevailing
scientific views and methods, with the object of showing that
true knowledge could only be gained by the logical application
of the principles of experiment and deduction. Boyle&rsquo;s masterly
exposition of this method is his most important contribution to
scientific progress. At the same time he clarified the conception
of elements and compounds, rejecting the older notions, the
four elements of the &ldquo;vulgar Peripateticks&rdquo; and the three
principles of the &ldquo;vulgar Stagyrists,&rdquo; and defining an element
as a substance incapable of decomposition, and a compound
as composed of two or more elements. He explained chemical
combination on the hypotheses that matter consisted of minute
corpuscles, that by the coalescence of corpuscles of different
substances distinctly new corpuscles of a compound were formed, and
that each corpuscle had a certain affinity for other corpuscles.</p>

<p>Although Boyle practised the methods which he expounded,
he was unable to gain general acceptance of his doctrine of
elements; and, strangely enough, the theory which
next dominated chemical thought was an alchemical
<span class="sidenote">Phlogistic theory.</span>
invention, and lacked the lucidity and perspicuity
of Boyle&rsquo;s views. This theory, named the phlogistic theory,
was primarily based upon certain experiments on combustion
and calcination, and in effect reduced the number of the
alchemical principles, while setting up a new one, a principle
of combustibility, named phlogiston (from <span class="grk" title="phlogistos">&#966;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span>, burnt).
Much discussion had centred about fire or the &ldquo;igneous principle.&rdquo;
On the one hand, it had been held that when a substance was
burned or calcined, it combined with an &ldquo;air&rdquo;; on the other
hand, the operation was supposed to be attended by the destruction
or loss of the igneous principle. Georg Ernst Stahl, following
in some measure the views held by Johann Joachim Becher, as,
for instance, that all combustibles contain a &ldquo;sulphur&rdquo; (which
notion is itself of older date than Becher&rsquo;s <i>terra pinguis</i>), regarded
all substances as capable of resolution into two components,
the inflammable principle phlogiston, and another element&mdash;&ldquo;water,&rdquo;
&ldquo;acid&rdquo; or &ldquo;earth.&rdquo; The violence or completeness
of combustion was proportional to the amount of phlogiston
present. Combustion meant the liberation of phlogiston.
Metals on calcination gave calces from which the metals could
be recovered by adding phlogiston, and experiment showed that
this could generally be effected by the action of coal or carbon,
which was therefore regarded as practically pure phlogiston;
the other constituent being regarded as an acid. At the hands
of Stahl and his school, the phlogistic theory, by exhibiting a
fundamental similarity between all processes of combustion
and by its remarkable flexibility, came to be a general theory
of chemical action. The objections of the antiphlogistonists,
such as the fact that calces weigh more than the original metals
instead of less as the theory suggests, were answered by postulating
that phlogiston was a principle of levity, or even completely
ignored as an accident, the change of <i>qualities</i> being regarded
as the only matter of importance. It is remarkable that this
theory should have gained the esteem of the notable chemists
who flourished in the 18th century. Henry Cavendish, a careful
and accurate experimenter, was a phlogistonist, as were
J. Black, K. W. Scheele, A. S. Marggraf, J. Priestley and many
others who might be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span></p>

<p>Descriptive chemistry was now assuming considerable proportions;
the experimental inquiries suggested by Boyle were
being assiduously developed; and a wealth of observations
<span class="sidenote">Lavoisier.</span>
was being accumulated, for the explanation of
which the resources of the dominant theory were sorely taxed.
To quote Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, &ldquo;... chemists have
turned phlogiston into a vague principle, ... which consequently
adapts itself to all the explanations for which it may be
required. Sometimes this principle has weight, and sometimes
it has not; sometimes it is free fire and sometimes it is fire
combined with the earthy element; sometimes it passes through
the pores of vessels, sometimes these are impervious to it; it
explains both causticity and non-causticity, transparency and
opacity, colours and their absence; it is a veritable Proteus
changing in form at each instant.&rdquo; Lavoisier may be justly
regarded as the founder of modern or quantitative chemistry.
First and foremost, he demanded that the balance must be used
in all investigations into chemical changes. He established as
fundamental that combustion and calcination were attended
by an increase of weight, and concluded, as did Jean Rey and
John Mayow in the 17th century, that the increase was due to
the combination of the metal with the air. The problem could
obviously be completely solved only when the composition of the
air, and the parts played by its components, had been determined.
At all times the air had received attention, especially since van
Helmont made his far-reaching investigations on gases. Mayow
had suggested the existence of two components, a <i>spiritus nitroaerus</i>
which supported combustion, and a <i>spiritus nitri acidi</i>
which extinguished fire; J. Priestley and K. W. Scheele,
although they isolated oxygen, were fogged by the phlogistic
tenets; and H. Cavendish, who had isolated the nitrogen
of the atmosphere, had failed to decide conclusively what
had really happened to the air which disappeared during
combustion.</p>

<p>Lavoisier adequately recognized and acknowledged how
much he owed to the researches of others; to himself is due
the co-ordination of these researches, and the welding of his
results into a doctrine to which the phlogistic theory ultimately
succumbed. He burned phosphorus in air standing over
mercury, and showed that (1) there was a limit to the amount
of phosphorus which could be burned in the confined air,
(2) that when no more phosphorus could be burned, one-fifth of the
air had disappeared, (3) that the weight of the air lost was nearly
equal to the difference in the weights of the white solid produced
and the phosphorus burned, (4) that the density of the residual
air was less than that of ordinary air. The same results were
obtained with lead and tin; and a more elaborate repetition
indubitably established their correctness. He also showed that
on heating mercury calx alone an &ldquo;air&rdquo; was liberated which
differed from other &ldquo;airs,&rdquo; and was slightly heavier than ordinary
air; moreover, the weight of the &ldquo;air&rdquo; set free from a given
weight of the calx was equal to the weight taken up in forming
the calx from mercury, and if the calx be heated with charcoal,
the metal was recovered and a gas named &ldquo;fixed air,&rdquo; the modern
carbon dioxide, was formed. The former experiment had been
performed by Scheele and Priestley, who had named the gas
&ldquo;phlogisticated air&rdquo;; Lavoisier subsequently named it oxygen,
regarding it as the &ldquo;acid producer&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="oxys">&#8000;&#958;&#973;&#962;</span>, sour). The theory
advocated by Lavoisier came to displace the phlogistic conception;
but at first its acceptance was slow. Chemical literature
was full of the phlogistic modes of expression&mdash;oxygen was
&ldquo;dephlogisticated air,&rdquo; nitrogen &ldquo;phlogisticated air,&rdquo; &amp;c.&mdash;and
this tended to retard its promotion. Yet really the transition
from the one theory to the other was simple, it being only
necessary to change the &ldquo;addition or loss of phlogiston&rdquo; into
the &ldquo;loss or addition of oxygen.&rdquo; By his insistence upon the
use of the balance as a quantitative check upon the masses
involved in all chemical reactions, Lavoisier was enabled to
establish by his own investigations and the results achieved
by others the principle now known as the &ldquo;conservation of
mass.&rdquo; Matter can neither be created nor destroyed; however
a chemical system be changed, the weights before and after are
equal.<a name="FnAnchor_2b" id="FnAnchor_2b" href="#Footnote_2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> To him is also due a rigorous examination of the nature
of elements and compounds; he held the same views that were
laid down by Boyle, and with the same prophetic foresight
predicted that some of the elements which he himself accepted
might be eventually found to be compounds.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary in this place to recapitulate the many
results which had accumulated by the end of the 18th century,
or to discuss the labours and theories of individual workers
since these receive attention under biographical headings;
in this article only the salient features in the history of our
science can be treated. The beginning of the 19th century
was attended by far-reaching discoveries in the nature of the
composition of compounds. Investigations proceeded in two
directions:&mdash;(1) the nature of chemical affinity, (2) the laws
<span class="sidenote">Chemical Affinity.</span>
of chemical combination. The first question has not
yet been solved, although it has been speculated upon
from the earliest times. The alchemists explained
chemical action by means of such phrases as &ldquo;like attracts
like,&rdquo; substances being said to combine when one &ldquo;loved&rdquo;
the other, and the reverse when it &ldquo;hated&rdquo; it. Boyle rejected
this terminology, which was only strictly applicable to intelligent
beings; and he used the word &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; as had been previously
done by Stahl and others. The modern sense of the word, viz.
the force which holds chemically dissimilar substances together
(and also <i>similar</i> substances as is seen in di-, tri-, and poly-atomic
molecules), was introduced by Hermann Boerhaave, and made
more precise by Sir Isaac Newton. The laws of chemical combination
were solved, in a measure, by John Dalton, and the
solution expressed as Dalton&rsquo;s &ldquo;atomic theory.&rdquo; Lavoisier
appears to have assumed that the composition of every chemical
compound was constant, and the same opinion was the basis
of much experimental inquiry at the hands of Joseph Louis
Proust during 1801 to 1809, who vigorously combated the
doctrine of Claude Louis Berthollet (<i>Essai de statique chimique</i>,
1803), viz. that fixed proportions of elements and compounds
combine only under exceptional conditions, the general rule
being that the composition of a compound may vary continuously
between certain limits.<a name="FnAnchor_3b" id="FnAnchor_3b" href="#Footnote_3b"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>This controversy was unfinished when Dalton published the
first part of his <i>New System of Chemical Philosophy</i> in 1808,
although the <i>per saltum</i> theory was the most popular.
<span class="sidenote">Dalton.</span>
Led thereto by speculations on gases, Dalton assumed
that matter was composed of atoms, that in the elements the
atoms were simple, and in compounds complex, being composed
of elementary atoms. Dalton furthermore perceived that the
same two elements or substances may combine in different
proportions, and showed that these proportions had always a
simple ratio to one another. This is the &ldquo;law of multiple
proportions.&rdquo; He laid down the following arbitrary rules for
determining the number of atoms in a compound:&mdash;if only one
compound of two elements exists, it is a binary compound and
its atom is composed of one atom of each element; if two
compounds exist one is binary (say A + B) and the other ternary
(say A + 2B); if three, then one is binary and the others may be
ternary (A + 2B, and 2A + B), and so on. More important is his
deduction of equivalent weights, <i>i.e.</i> the relative weights of
atoms. He took hydrogen, the lightest substance known, to
be the standard. From analyses of water, which he regarded
as composed of one atom of hydrogen and one of oxygen, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
deduced the relative weight of the oxygen atom to be 6.5;
from marsh gas and olefiant gas he deduced carbon = 5, there
being one atom of carbon and two of hydrogen in the former
and one atom of hydrogen to one of carbon in the latter;
nitrogen had an equivalent of 5, and so on.<a name="FnAnchor_4b" id="FnAnchor_4b" href="#Footnote_4b"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p>The value of Dalton&rsquo;s generalizations can hardly be overestimated,
notwithstanding the fact that in several cases they
needed correction. The first step in this direction was effected
by the co-ordination of Gay Lussac&rsquo;s observations on the
combining volumes of gases. He discovered that gases always
combined in volumes having simple ratios, and that the volume
of the product had a simple ratio to the volumes of the reacting
gases. For example, one volume of oxygen combined with two
of hydrogen to form two volumes of steam, three volumes of
hydrogen combined with one of nitrogen to give two volumes
of ammonia, one volume of hydrogen combined with one of
chlorine to give two volumes of hydrochloric acid. An immediate
inference was that the Daltonian &ldquo;atom&rdquo; must have parts
which enter into combination with parts of other atoms; in
other words, there must exist two orders of particles, viz.
(1) particles derived by limiting <i>mechanical</i> subdivision, the modern
<i>molecule</i>, and (2) particles derived from the first class by <i>chemical</i>
subdivision, <i>i.e.</i> particles which are incapable of existing alone,
but may exist in combination. Additional evidence as to the
structure of the molecule was discussed by Avogadro in 1811,
and by Ampere in 1814. From the gas-laws of Boyle and J.A.C.
Charles&mdash;viz. equal changes in temperature and pressure
occasion equal changes in equal volumes of all gases and
vapours&mdash;Avogadro deduced the law:&mdash;Under the same conditions
of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain
equal numbers of molecules; and he showed that the relative
weights of the molecules are determined as the ratios of the
weights of equal volumes, or densities. He established the
existence of molecules and atoms as we have defined above,
and stated that the number of atoms in the molecule is generally
2, but may be 4, 8, &amp;c. We cannot tell whether his choice of the
powers of 2 is accident or design.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Avogadro&rsquo;s perspicuous investigation, and
a similar exposition of the atom and molecule by A. M. Ampere,
the views therein expressed were ignored both by
<span class="sidenote">Berzelius.</span>
their own and the succeeding generation. In place
of the relative molecular weights, attention was concentrated
on relative atomic or equivalent weights. This may be due
in some measure to the small number of gaseous and easily
volatile substances then known, to the attention which the
study of the organic compounds received, and especially to the
energetic investigations of J. J. Berzelius, who, fired with
enthusiasm by the original theory of Dalton and the law of
multiple proportions, determined the equivalents of combining
ratios of many elements in an enormous number of compounds.<a name="FnAnchor_5b" id="FnAnchor_5b" href="#Footnote_5b"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
He prosecuted his labours in this field for thirty years; as
proof of his industry it may be mentioned that as early as 1818
he had determined the combining ratios of about two thousand
simple and compound substances.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>We may here notice the important chemical symbolism or notation
introduced by Berzelius, which greatly contributed to the definite
and convenient representation of chemical composition
<span class="sidenote">Chemical notation.</span>
and the tracing of chemical reactions. The denotation of
elements by symbols had been practised by the alchemists,
and it is interesting to note that the symbols allotted to the well-known
elements are identical with the astrological symbols of the sun and
the other members of the solar system. Gold, the most perfect metal,
had the symbol of the Sun, &#9737;; silver, the semiperfect metal, had
the symbol of the Moon, &#9789;; copper, iron and antimony, the
imperfect metals of the gold class, had the symbols of Venus &#9792;,
Mars &#9794;, and the Earth &#9793;; tin and lead, the imperfect metals of
the silver class, had the symbols of Jupiter &#9795;, and Saturn &#9796;;
while mercury, the imperfect metal of both the gold and silver
class, had the symbol of the planet, &#9791;. Torbern Olof Bergman used
an elaborate system in his <i>Opuscula physica et chemica</i> (1783); the
elements received symbols composed of circles, arcs of circles, and
lines, while certain class symbols, such as <img style="width:40px; height:25px" src="images/img36a.jpg" alt="" /> for metals, <img style="width:40px; height:45px" src="images/img36b.jpg" alt="" /> for acids,
<img style="width:40px; height:38px" src="images/img36c.jpg" alt="" /> for alkalies, <img style="width:40px; height:44px" src="images/img36d.jpg" alt="" /> for salts, <img style="width:40px; height:47px" src="images/img36e.jpg" alt="" /> for calces, &amp;c., were used. Compounds
were represented by copulating simpler symbols, <i>e.g.</i> mercury calx
was <img style="width:70px; height:40px" src="images/img36f.jpg" alt="" />.<a name="FnAnchor_6b" id="FnAnchor_6b" href="#Footnote_6b"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Bergman&rsquo;s symbolism was obviously cumbrous, and
the system used in 1782 by Lavoisier was equally abstruse, since the
forms gave no clue as to composition; for instance water, oxygen,
and nitric acid were <img style="width:81px; height:40px" src="images/img36g.jpg" alt="" />, and <img style="width:53px; height:40px" src="images/img36h.jpg" alt="" />.</p>

<p>A partial clarification was suggested in 1787 by J.H. Hassenfratz
and Adet, who assigned to each element a symbol, and to each compound
a sign which should record the elements present and their
relative quantities. Straight lines and semicircles were utilized for
the non-metallic elements, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur
(the &ldquo;simple acidifiable bases&rdquo; of Lavoisier), and circles enclosing
the initial letters of their names for the metals. The &ldquo;compound
acidifiable bases,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the hypothetical radicals of acids, were denoted
by squares enclosing the initial letter of the base; an alkali was
denoted by a triangle, and the particular alkali by inserting the
initial letter. Compounds were denoted by joining the symbols of
the components, and by varying the manner of joining compounds
of the same elements were distinguished. The symbol \/ was used
to denote a liquid, and a vertical line to denote a gas. As an
example of the complexity of this system we may note the five
oxides of nitrogen, which were symbolized as</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:203px; height:40px" src="images/img36i.jpg" alt="" /> and <img style="width:51px; height:40px" src="images/img36j.jpg" alt="" />,</p>

<p class="noind">the first three representing the gaseous oxides, and the last two the
liquid oxides.</p>

<p>A great advance was made by Dalton, who, besides introducing
simpler symbols, regarded the symbol as representing not only the
element or compound but also one atom of that element or compound;
in other words, his symbol denoted equivalent weights.<a name="FnAnchor_7b" id="FnAnchor_7b" href="#Footnote_7b"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
This system, which permitted the correct representation of molecular
composition, was adopted by Berzelius in 1814, who, having replaced
the geometric signs of Dalton by the initial letter (or letters) of the
Latin names of the elements, represented a compound by placing a
<i>plus</i> sign between the symbols of its components, and the number of
atoms of each component (except in the case of only one atom) by
placing Arabic numerals before the symbols; for example, copper
oxide was Cu+O, sulphur trioxide S+3O. If two compounds combined,
the + signs of the free compounds were discarded, and the
number of atoms denoted by an Arabic index placed after the
elements, and from these modified symbols the symbol of the new
compound was derived in the same manner as simple compounds
were built up from their elements. Thus copper sulphate was
CuO + SO<span class="su">3</span>, potassium sulphate 2SO<span class="su">3</span> + PoO<span class="su">2</span> (the symbol Po for
potassium was subsequently discarded in favour of K from <i>kalium</i>).
At a later date Berzelius denoted an oxide by dots, equal in number to
the number of oxygen atoms present, placed over the element; this
notation survived longest in mineralogy. He also introduced barred
symbols, <i>i.e.</i> letters traversed by a horizontal bar, to denote the double
atom (or molecule). Although the system of Berzelius has been
modified and extended, its principles survive in the modern notation.</p>
</div>

<p>In the development of the atomic theory and the deduction
of the atomic weights of elements and the formulae of compounds,
Dalton&rsquo;s arbitrary rules failed to find complete acceptance.
<span class="sidenote">Extension of the atomic theory.</span>
Berzelius objected to the hypothesis that if
two elements form only one compound, then the
atoms combine one and one; and although he agreed
with the adoption of simple rules as a first attempt at representing
a compound, he availed himself of other data in order to gain
further information as to the structure of compounds. For
example, at first he represented ferrous and ferric oxides by the
formulae FeO<span class="su">2</span>, FeO<span class="su">3</span>, and by the analogy of zinc and other
basic oxides he regarded these substances as constituted similarly
to FeO<span class="su">2</span>, and the acidic oxides alumina and chromium oxide as
similar to FeO<span class="su">3</span>. He found, however, that chromic acid, which
he had represented as CrO<span class="su">6</span>, neutralized a base containing 1/3 the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
quantity of oxygen. He inferred that chromic acid must
contain only three atoms of oxygen, as did sulphuric acid SO<span class="su">3</span>;
consequently chromic oxide, which contains half the amount
of oxygen, must be Cr<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, and hence ferric oxide must be Fe<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>.
The basic oxides must have the general formula MO. To these
results he was aided by the law of isomorphism formulated by
E. Mitscherlich in 1820; and he confirmed his conclusions by
showing the agreement with the law of atomic heat formulated
by Dulong and Petit in 1819.</p>

<p>While successfully investigating the solid elements and their
compounds gravimetrically, Berzelius was guilty of several
inconsistencies in his views on gases. He denied that gaseous
atoms could have parts, although compound gases could. This
attitude was due to his adherence to the &ldquo;dualistic theory&rdquo;
of the structure of substances, which he deduced from
electrochemical researches. From the behaviour of substances on
electrolysis (<i>q.v.</i>) he assumed that all substances had two
components, one bearing a negative charge, the other a positive
charge. Combination was associated with the coalescence of
these charges, and the nature of the resulting compound showed
the nature of the residual electricity. For example, positive
iron combined with negative oxygen to form positive ferrous
oxide; positive sulphur combined with negative oxygen to
form negative sulphuric acid; positive ferrous oxide combined
with negative sulphuric acid to form neutral ferrous sulphate.
Berzelius elevated this theory to an important position in the
history of our science. He recognized that if an elementary
atom had parts, his theory demanded that these parts should
carry different electric charges when they entered into reaction,
and the products of the reaction should vary according as a
positive or negative atom entered into combination. For
instance if the reaction 2H<span class="su">2</span> + O<span class="su">2</span> = H<span class="su">2</span>O + H<span class="su">2</span>O be true, the
molecules of water should be different, for a negative oxygen
atom would combine in one case, and a positive oxygen atom
in the other. Hence the gaseous atoms of hydrogen and oxygen
could not have parts. A second inconsistency was presented
when he was compelled by the researches of Dumas to admit
Avogadro&rsquo;s hypothesis; but here he would only accept it for
the elementary gases, and denied it for other substances. It is
to be noticed that J.B. Dumas did not adopt the best methods
for emphasizing his discoveries. His terminology was vague
and provoked caustic criticism from Berzelius; he assumed
that all molecules contained two atoms, and consequently the
atomic weights deduced from vapour density determinations of
sulphur, mercury, arsenic, and phosphorus were quite different
from those established by gravimetric and other methods.</p>

<p>Chemists gradually tired of the notion of atomic weights on
account of the uncertainty which surrounded them; and the
suggestion made by W.H. Wollaston as early as 1814 to deal
only with &ldquo;equivalents,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the amount of an element which
can combine with or replace unit weight of hydrogen, came
into favour, being adopted by L. Gmelin in his famous text-book.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with this discussion of the atom and molecule,
great controversy was ranging over the constitution of
compounds, more particularly over the carbon or organic
<span class="sidenote">Atomic and molecular weights.</span>
compounds. This subject is discussed in section IV.,
<i>Organic Chemistry</i>.The gradual accumulation of data
referring to organic compounds brought in its train a
revival of the discussion of atoms and molecules. A. Laurent
and C.F. Gerhardt attempted a solution by investigating chemical
reactions. They assumed the atom to be the smallest part of
matter which can exist in combination, and the molecule to be
the smallest part which can enter into a chemical reaction.
Gerhardt found that reactions could be best followed if one
assumed the molecular weight of an element or compound to be
that weight which occupied the same volume as two unit weights
of hydrogen, and this assumption led him to double the equivalents
accepted by Gmelin, making H = 1, O = 16, and C = 12,
thereby agreeing with Berzelius, and also to halve the values
given by Berzelius to many metals. Laurent generally agreed,
except when the theory compelled the adoption of formulae
containing fractions of atoms; in such cases he regarded the
molecular weight as the weight occupying a volume equal to
four unit weights of hydrogen. The bases upon which Gerhardt
and Laurent founded their views were not sufficiently well
grounded to lead to the acceptance of their results; Gerhardt
himself returned to Gmelin&rsquo;s equivalents in his <i>Lehrbuch der
Chemie</i> (1853) as they were in such general use.</p>

<p>In 1860 there prevailed such a confusion of hypotheses as to
the atom and molecule that a conference was held at Karlsruhe
to discuss the situation. At the conclusion of the sitting,
Lothar Meyer obtained a paper written by Stanislas Cannizzaro
in 1858 wherein was found the final link required for the
determination of atomic weights. This link was the full extension
of Avogadro&rsquo;s theory to all substances, Cannizzaro showing that
chemical reactions in themselves would not suffice. He chose
as his unit of reference the weight of an atom of hydrogen, i.e.
the weight contained in a molecule of hydrochloric acid, thus
differing from Avogadro who chose the weight of a hydrogen
molecule. From a study of the free elements Cannizzaro showed
that an element may have more than one molecular weight; for
example, the molecular weight of sulphur varied with the
temperature. And from the study of compounds he showed that
each element occurred in a definite weight or in some multiple
of this weight. He called this proportion the &ldquo;atom,&rdquo; since
it invariably enters compounds without division, and the weight
of this atom is the atomic weight. This generalization was of
great value inasmuch as it permitted the deduction of the
atomic weight of a non-gasifiable element from a study of the
densities of its gasifiable compounds.</p>

<p>From the results obtained by Laurent and Gerhardt and their
predecessors it immediately followed that, while an element could
have but one atomic weight, it could have several equivalent
weights. From a detailed study of organic compounds Gerhardt
had promulgated a &ldquo;theory of types&rdquo; which represented
a fusion of the older radical and type theories. This theory
brought together, as it were, the most varied compounds, and
stimulated inquiry into many fields. According to this theory,
an element in a compound had a definite saturation capacity,
an idea very old in itself, being framed in the law of multiple
<span class="sidenote">Valency.</span>
proportions. These saturation capacities were
assiduously studied by Sir Edward Frankland, who from
the investigation, not of simple inorganic compounds, but of the
organo-metallic derivatives, determined the kernel of the theory
of valency. Frankland showed that any particular element
preferentially combined with a definite number (which might
vary between certain limits) of other atoms; for example, some
atoms always combined with one atom of oxygen, some with two,
while with others two atoms entered into combination with one
of oxygen. If an element or radical combined with one atom
of hydrogen, it was termed monovalent; if with two (or with
one atom of oxygen, which is equivalent to two atoms of hydrogen)
it was divalent, and so on. The same views were expressed by
Cannizzaro, and also by A.W. von Hofmann, who materially
helped the acceptance of the doctrine by the lucid exposition in
his <i>Introduction to Modern Chemistry</i>, 1865.</p>

<p>The recognition of the quadrivalency of carbon by A. Kekulé
was the forerunner of his celebrated benzene theory in particular,
and of the universal application of structural formulae to the
representation of the most complex organic compounds equally
lucidly as the representation of the simplest salts. Alexander
Butlerow named the &ldquo;structure theory,&rdquo; and contributed much
to the development of the subject. He defined structure &ldquo;as the
manner of the mutual linking of the atoms in the molecule,&rdquo;
but denied that any such structure could give information as to
the orientation of the atoms in space. He regarded the chemical
properties of a substance as due to (1) the chemical atoms
composing it, and (2) the structure, and he asserted that while
different compounds might have the same components (isomerism),
yet only one compound could have a particular structure.
Identity in properties necessitated identity in structure.</p>

<p>While the principle of varying valency laid down by Frankland
is still retained, Butlerow&rsquo;s view that structure had no spatial
significance has been modified. The researches of L. Pasteur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
J.A. Le Bel, J. Wislicenus, van&rsquo;t Hoff and others showed that
substances having the same graphic formulae vary in properties
and reactions, and consequently the formulae need modification in
order to exhibit these differences. Such isomerism, named stereoisomerism
(<i>q.v.</i>), has been assiduously developed during recent years;
it prevails among many different classes of organic compounds
and many examples have been found in inorganic chemistry.</p>

<p>The theory of valency as a means of showing similarity of
properties and relative composition became a dominant feature
of chemical theory, the older hypotheses of types, radicals, &amp;c.
being more or less discarded. We have seen how its
<span class="sidenote">Periodic law.</span>
utilization in the &ldquo;structure theory&rdquo; permitted great
clarification, and attempts were not wanting for the
deduction of analogies or a periodicity between elements. Frankland
had recognized the analogies existing between the chemical
properties of nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony,
noting that they act as tri- or penta-valent. Carbon was joined
with silicon, zirconium and titanium, while boron, being trivalent,
was relegated to another group. A general classification
of elements, however, was not realized by Frankland, nor even by
Odling, who had also investigated the question from the valency
standpoint. The solution came about by arranging the elements
in the order of their atomic weights, tempering the arrangement
with the results deduced from the theory of valencies and
experimental observations. Many chemists contributed to the
establishment of such a periodicity, the greatest advances being
made by John Newlands in England, Lothar Meyer in Germany,
and D.J. Mendeléeff in St Petersburg. For the development of
this classification see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Element</a></span>.</p>

<p>In the above sketch we have briefly treated the history of the
main tendencies of our science from the earliest times to the
establishment of the modern laws and principles. We
<span class="sidenote">Summary.</span>
have seen that the science took its origin in the arts
practised by the Egyptians, and, having come under the influence
of philosophers, it chose for its purpose the isolation of the
<i>quinta essentia</i>, and subsequently the &ldquo;art of making gold and
silver.&rdquo; This spirit gave way to the physicians, who regarded
&ldquo;chemistry as the art of preparing medicines,&rdquo; a denotation
which in turn succumbed to the arguments of Boyle, who regarded
it as the &ldquo;science of the composition of substances,&rdquo; a definition
which adequately fits the science to-day. We have seen how
his classification of substances into elements and compounds,
and the definitions which he assigned to these species, have
similarly been retained; and how Lavoisier established the law
of the &ldquo;conservation of mass,&rdquo; overthrew the prevailing phlogistic
theory, and became the founder of modern chemistry by the
overwhelming importance which he gave to the use of the balance.
The development of the atomic theory and its concomitants&mdash;the
laws of chemical combination and the notion of atoms and
equivalents&mdash;at the hands of Dalton and Berzelius, the extension
to the modern theory of the atom and molecule, and to atomic
and molecular weights by Avogadro, Ampère, Dumas, Laurent,
Gerhardt, Cannizzaro and others, have been noted. The
structure of the molecule, which mainly followed investigations
in organic compounds, Frankland&rsquo;s conception of valency, and
finally the periodic law, have also been shown in their
chronological order. The principles outlined above constitute the
foundations of our science; and although it may happen that
experiments may be made with which they appear to be not in
complete agreement, yet in general they constitute a body of
working hypotheses of inestimable value.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Education.</i>&mdash;It is remarkable that systematic
instruction in the theory and practice of chemistry only received
earnest attention in our academic institutions during the opening
decades of the 19th century. Although for a long time lecturers
and professors had been attached to universities, generally their
duties had also included the study of physics, mineralogy and
other subjects, with the result that chemistry received scanty
encouragement. Of practical instruction there was none other
than that to be gained in a few private laboratories and in the
shops of apothecaries. The necessity for experimental
demonstration and practical instruction, in addition to academic
lectures, appears to have been urged by the French chemists
L.N. Vauquelin, Gay Lussac, Thénard, and more especially by
A.F. Fourcroy and G.F. Rouelle, while in England Humphry
Davy expounded the same idea in the experimental demonstrations
which gave his lectures their brilliant charm. But the real
founder of systematic instruction in our science was Justus von
Liebig, who, having accepted the professorship at Giessen in
1824, made his chemical laboratory and course of instruction
the model of all others. He emphasized that the practical
training should include (1) the qualitative and quantitative
analysis of mixtures, (2) the preparation of substances according
to established methods, (3) original research&mdash;a course which has
been generally adopted. The pattern set by Liebig at Giessen
was adopted by F. Wöhler at Göttingen in 1836, by R.W.
Bunsen at Marburg in 1840, and by O.L. Erdmann at Leipzig
in 1843; and during the &rsquo;fifties and &rsquo;sixties many other laboratories
were founded. A new era followed the erection of the
laboratories at Bonn and Berlin according to the plans of A.W.
von Hofmann in 1867, and of that at Leipzig, designed by Kolbe
in 1868. We may also mention the famous laboratory at Munich
designed by A. von Baeyer in 1875.</p>

<p>In Great Britain the first public laboratory appears to have
been opened in 1817 by Thomas Thomson at Glasgow. But the
first important step in providing means whereby students could
systematically study chemistry was the foundation of the College
of Chemistry in 1845. This institution was taken over by the
Government in 1853, becoming the Royal College of Chemistry,
and incorporated with the Royal School of Mines; in 1881 the
names were changed to the Normal School of Science and Royal
School of Mines, and again in 1890 to the Royal College of
Science. In 1907 it was incorporated in the Imperial College of
Science and Technology. Under A.W. von Hofmann, who
designed the laboratories and accepted the professorship in 1845
at the instigation of Prince Albert, and under his successor (in
1864) Sir Edward Frankland, this institution became one of
the most important centres of chemical instruction. Oxford
and Cambridge sadly neglected the erection of convenient
laboratories for many years, and consequently we find technical
schools and other universities having a far better equipment and
offering greater facilities. In the provinces Victoria University
at Manchester exercised the greater impetus, numbering among
its professors Sir W.H. Perkin and Sir Henry Roscoe.</p>

<p>In America public laboratory instruction was first instituted at
Yale College during the professorship of Benjamin Silliman. To
the great progress made in recent years F.W. Clarke, W. Gibbs,
E.W. Morley, Ira Remsen, and T.W. Richards have especially
contributed.</p>

<p>In France the subject was almost entirely neglected until
late in the 19th century. The few laboratories existing in the
opening decades were ill-fitted, and the exorbitant fees constituted
a serious bar to general instruction, for these institutions
received little government support. In 1869 A. Wurtz reported
the existence of only <i>one</i> efficient laboratory in France, namely
the École Normale Supérieure, under the direction of H. Sainte
Claire Deville. During recent years chemistry has become
one of the most important subjects in the curriculum of technical
schools and universities, and at the present time no general
educational institution is complete until it has its full equipment
of laboratories and lecture theatres.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Chemical Literature</i>.&mdash;The growth of chemical literature since the
publication of Lavoisier&rsquo;s famous <i>Traité de chimie</i> in 1789, and of
Berzelius&rsquo; <i>Lehrbuch der Chemie</i> in 1808-1818, has been enormous.
These two works, and especially the latter, were the models followed
by Thénard, Liebig, Strecker, Wöhler and many others, including
Thomas Graham, upon whose <i>Elements of Chemistry</i> was founded
Otto&rsquo;s famous <i>Lehrbuch der Chemie</i>, to which H. Kopp contributed
the general theoretical part, Kolbe the organic, and Buff and
Zamminer the physico-chemical. Organic chemistry was especially
developed by the publication of Gerhardt&rsquo;s <i>Traité de chimie organique</i>
in 1853-1856, and of Kekulé&rsquo;s <i>Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie</i> in
1861-1882. General theoretical and physical chemistry was treated
with conspicuous acumen by Lothar Meyer in his <i>Moderne Theorien,</i>
by W. Ostwald in his <i>Lehrbuch der allgem. Chemie</i> (1884-1887), and
by Nernst in his <i>Theoretische Chemie</i>. In English, Roscoe and
Schorlemmer&rsquo;s <i>Treatise on Chemistry</i> is a standard work; it records
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
a successful attempt to state the theories and facts of chemistry,
not in condensed epitomes, but in an easily read form. The <i>Traité
de chimie minérale</i>, edited by H. Moissan, and the <i>Handbuch der
anorganischen Chemie</i>, edited by Abegg, are of the same type.
O. Dammer&rsquo;s <i>Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie</i> and F. Beilstein&rsquo;s
<i>Handbuch der organischen Chemie</i> are invaluable works of reference.
Of the earlier encyclopaedias we may notice the famous <i>Handwörterbuch
der reinen und angewandten Chemie</i>, edited by Liebig;
Frémy&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopédie de chimie</i>, Wurtz&rsquo;s <i>Dictionnaire de chimie
pure et appliquée</i>, Watts&rsquo; <i>Dictionary of Chemistry</i>, and Ladenburg&rsquo;s
<i>Handwörterbuch der Chemie</i>.</p>

<p>The number of periodicals devoted to chemistry has steadily
increased since the early part of the 19th century. In England the
most important is the <i>Journal of the Chemical Society of London</i>,
first published in 1848. Since 1871 abstracts of papers appearing
in the other journals have been printed. In 1904 a new departure
was made in issuing <i>Annual Reports</i>, containing résumés of the most
important researches of the year. The <i>Chemical News</i>, founded by
Sir W. Crookes in 1860, may also be noted. In America the chief
periodical is the <i>American Chemical Journal</i>, founded in 1879.
Germany is provided with a great number of magazines. The
<i>Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft</i>, published by the
Berlin Chemical Society, the <i>Chemisches Centralblatt</i>, which is confined
to abstracts of papers appearing in other journals, the <i>Zeitschrift
für Chemie</i>, and Liebig&rsquo;s <i>Annalen der Chemie</i> are the most important
of the general magazines. Others devoted to special phases are the
<i>Journal für praktische Chemie</i>, founded by Erdmann in 1834, the
<i>Zeitschrift für anorganische Chemie</i> and the <i>Zeitschrift für physikalische
Chemie</i>. Mention may also be made of the invaluable
<i>Jahresberichte</i> and the <i>Jahrbuch der Chemie</i>. In France, the most
important journals are the <i>Annales de chimie et de physique</i>, founded
in 1789 with the title <i>Annales de chimie</i>, and the <i>Comptes rendus</i>,
published weekly by the Académie française since 1835.</p>

non-metals, and the remainder as metals:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="80%" summary="Contents">

<tr><td class="tc5">Hydrogen</td>  <td class="tc5">Oxygen</td>  <td class="tc5">Boron</td>  <td class="tc5">Neon</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc5">Chlorine</td>  <td class="tc5">Sulphur</td>  <td class="tc5">Carbon</td>  <td class="tc5">Krypton</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc5">Bromine</td>  <td class="tc5">Selenium</td>  <td class="tc5">Silicon</td>  <td class="tc5">Xenon</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc5">Iodine</td>  <td class="tc5">Tellurium</td>  <td class="tc5">Phosphorus</td>  <td class="tc5">elium</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc5">Fluorine</td>  <td class="tc5">Nitrogen</td>  <td class="tc5">Argon</td>  <td class="tc5">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">Of these hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, oxygen, nitrogen, argon,
neon, krypton, xenon and helium are gases, bromine is a liquid,
and the remainder are solids. All the metals are solids at ordinary
temperatures with the exception of mercury, which is liquid.
The metals are mostly bodies of high specific gravity; they
exhibit, when polished, a peculiar brilliancy or metallic lustre,
and they are good conductors of heat and electricity; the non-metals,
on the other hand, are mostly bodies of low specific
gravity, and bad conductors of heat and electricity, and do not
exhibit metallic lustre. The non-metallic elements are also
sometimes termed metalloids, but this appellation, which signifies
metal-like substances (Gr. <span class="grk" title="eidos">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>, like), strictly belongs to certain
elements which do not possess the properties of the true metals,
although they more closely resemble them than the non-metals
in many respects; thus, selenium and tellurium, which are
closely allied to sulphur in their chemical properties, although
bad conductors of heat and electricity, exhibit metallic lustre
and have relatively high specific gravities. But when the
properties of the elements are carefully contrasted together it
is found that no strict line of demarcation can be drawn dividing
them into two classes; and if they are arranged in a series,
those which are most closely allied in properties being placed
next to each other, it is observed that there is a more or less
regular alteration in properties from term to term in the series.</p>

<p>When binary compounds, or compounds of two elements, are
decomposed by an electric current, the two elements make their
appearance at opposite poles. Those elements which are disengaged
at the negative pole are termed electro-positive, or
positive, or basylous elements, whilst those disengaged at the
positive pole are termed electro-negative, or negative, or chlorous
elements. But the difference between these two classes of
elements is one of degree only, and they gradually merge into
each other; moreover the electric relations of elements are not
absolute, but vary according to the state of combination in
which they exist, so that it is just as impossible to divide the
elements into two classes according to this property as it is to
separate them into two distinct classes of metals and non-metals.
The following, however, are negative towards the remaining
elements which are more or less positive:&mdash;Fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, iodine, oxygen, sulphur, selenium, tellurium.</p>

<p>The metals may be arranged in a series according to their
power of displacing one another in salt solutions, thus Cs, Rb,
K, Na, Mg, Al, Mn, Zn, Cd, Tl, Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, Pb, (H), Sb, Bi,
As, Cu, Hg, Ag, Pd, Pt, Au.</p>

<p>Elements which readily enter into reaction with each other,
and which develop a large amount of heat on combination, are
said to have a powerful affinity for each other. The tendency
of positive elements to unite with positive elements, or of negative
elements to unite with negative elements, is much less than that
of positive elements to unite with negative elements, and the
greater the difference in properties between two elements the
more powerful is their affinity for each other. Thus, the affinity
of hydrogen and oxygen for each other is extremely powerful,
much heat being developed by the combination of these two
elements; when binary compounds of oxygen are decomposed
by the electric current, the oxygen invariably appears at the
positive pole, being negative to all other elements, but the
hydrogen of hydrogen compounds is always disengaged at the
negative pole. Hydrogen and oxygen are, therefore, of very
opposite natures, and this is well illustrated by the circumstance
that oxygen combines, with very few exceptions, with all the
remaining elements, whilst compounds of only a limited number
with hydrogen have been obtained.</p>

<p><i>Compounds.</i>&mdash;A chemical compound contains two or more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
elements; consequently it should be possible to analyse it,
i.e. separate it into its components, or to synthesize it, <i>i.e.</i> build
it up from its components. In general, a compound has properties
markedly different from those of the elements of which
it is composed.</p>

<p><i>Laws of Chemical Combination.</i>&mdash;A <i>molecule</i> may be defined
as the smallest part of a substance which can exist alone; an
<i>atom</i> as the smallest part of a substance which can exist in combination.
The molecule of every compound must obviously
contain at least two atoms, and generally the molecules of the
elements are also polyatomic, the elements with monatomic
molecules (at moderate temperatures) being mercury and the
gases of the argon group. The laws of chemical combination are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Law of Definite Proportions.</i>&mdash;The same compound always
contains the same elements combined together in the same mass
proportion. Silver chloride, for example, in whatever manner
it may be prepared, invariably consists of chlorine and silver
in the proportions by weight of 35.45 parts of the former and
107.93 of the latter.</p>

<p>2. <i>Law of Multiple Proportions.</i>&mdash;When the same two elements
combine together to form more than one compound, the different
masses of one of the elements which unite with a constant mass
of the other, bear a simple ratio to one another. Thus, 1 part
by weight of hydrogen unites with 8 parts by weight of oxygen,
forming water, and with 16 or 8 &#215; 2 parts of oxygen, forming
hydrogen peroxide. Again, in nitrous oxide we have a compound
of 8 parts by weight of oxygen and 14 of nitrogen; in nitric oxide
a compound of 16 or 8 &#215; 2 parts of oxygen and 14 of nitrogen;
in nitrous anhydride a compound of 24 or 8 &#215; 3 parts of oxygen
and 14 of nitrogen; in nitric peroxide a compound of 32 or 8 &#215; 4
parts of oxygen and 14 of nitrogen; and lastly, in nitric anhydride
a compound of 40 or 8 &#215; 5 parts of oxygen and 14 of
nitrogen.</p>

<p>3. <i>Law of Reciprocal Proportions.</i>&mdash;The masses of different
elements which combine separately with one and the same mass
of another element, are either the same as, or simple multiples
of, the masses of these different elements which combine with
each other. For instance, 35.45 parts of chlorine and 79.96
parts of bromine combine with 107.93 parts of silver; and when
chlorine and bromine unite it is in the proportion of 35.45 parts
of the former to 79.96 parts of the latter. Iodine unites with
silver in the proportion of 126.97 parts to 107.93 parts of the
latter, but it combines with chlorine in two proportions, viz. in
the proportion of 126.97 parts either to 35.45 or to three times
35.45 parts of chlorine.</p>

<p>There is a fourth law of chemical combination which only
applies to gases. This law states that:&mdash;gases combine with one
another in simple proportions by volume, and the volume of the
product (if gaseous) has a simple ratio to the volumes of the
original mixtures; in other words, the densities of gases are
simply related to their combining weights.</p>

<p><i>Nomenclature.</i>&mdash;If a compound contains two atoms it is
termed a binary compound, if three a ternary, if four a quaternary,
and so on. Its systematic name is formed by replacing the last syllable
of the electro-negative element by <i>ide</i> and prefixing
the name of the other element. For example, compounds of
oxygen are <i>oxides</i>, of chlorine, <i>chlorides</i>, and so on. If more than
one compound be formed from the same two elements, the
difference is shown by prefixing such words as mono-, di-, tri-,
sesqui-, per-, sub-, &amp;c., to the last part of the name, or the
suffixes -<i>ous</i> and -<i>ic</i> may be appended to the name of the first
element. For example take the oxides of nitrogen, N<span class="su">2</span>O, NO,
N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, NO<span class="su">2</span>, N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span>; these are known respectively as nitrous oxide,
nitric oxide, nitrogen trioxide, nitrogen peroxide and nitrogen
pentoxide. The affixes -<i>ous</i> and <i>sub</i>- refer to the compounds
containing more of the positive element, -<i>ic</i> and <i>per</i>- to those
containing less.</p>

<p>An <i>acid</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) is a compound of hydrogen, which element can
be replaced by metals, the hydrogen being liberated, giving
substances named <i>salts</i>. An <i>alkali</i> or <i>base</i> is a substance which
neutralizes an acid with the production of salts but with no
evolution of hydrogen. A base may be regarded as water in
which part of the hydrogen is replaced by a metal, or by a
radical which behaves as a metal. (The term <i>radical</i> is given
to a group of atoms which persist in chemical changes, behaving
as if the group were an element; the commonest is the
ammonium group, NH<span class="su">4</span>, which forms salts similar to the salts
of sodium and potassium.) If the acid contains no oxygen it is a
<i>hydracid</i>, and its systematic name is formed from the prefix
<i>hydro</i>- and the name of the other element or radical, the last
syllable of which has been replaced by the termination -<i>ic</i>. For
example, the acid formed by hydrogen and chlorine is termed
hydrochloric acid (and sometimes hydrogen chloride). If an
acid contains oxygen it is termed an <i>oxyacid</i>. The nomenclature
of acids follows the same general lines as that for binary compounds.
If one acid be known its name is formed by the termination
-<i>ic</i>, <i>e.g.</i> carbonic acid; if two, the one containing the
less amount of oxygen takes the termination <i>-ous</i> and the other
the termination -<i>ic</i>, <i>e.g.</i> nitrous acid, HNO<span class="su">2</span>, nitric acid, HNO<span class="su">3</span>.
If more than two be known, the one inferior in oxygen content
has the prefix <i>hypo</i>- and the termination -<i>ous</i>, and the one
superior in oxygen content has the prefix <i>per</i>- and the termination
-<i>ic</i>. This is illustrated in the four oxyacids of chlorine, HClO,
HClO<span class="su">2</span>, HClO<span class="su">3</span>, HClO<span class="su">4</span>, which have the names hypochlorous,
chlorous, chloric and perchloric acids. An acid is said to be
monobasic, dibasic, tribasic, &amp;c., according to the number of
replaceable hydrogen atoms; thus HNO<span class="su">3</span> is monobasic, sulphuric
acid H<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span> dibasic, phosphoric acid H<span class="su">3</span>PO<span class="su">4</span> tribasic.</p>

<p>An acid terminating in -<i>ous</i> forms a salt ending in -<i>ite</i>, and an
oxyacid ending in -<i>ic</i> forms a salt ending in -<i>ate</i>. Thus the
chlorine oxyacids enumerated above form salts named respectively
hypochlorites, chlorites, chlorates and perchlorates. Salts
formed from hydracids terminate in -<i>ide</i>, following the rule
for binary compounds. An <i>acid</i> salt is one in which the whole
amount of hydrogen has not been replaced by metal; a <i>normal</i>
salt is one in which all the hydrogen has been replaced; and a
<i>basic</i> salt is one in which part of the acid of the normal salt has
been replaced by oxygen.</p>

<p><i>Chemical Formulae.</i>&mdash;Opposite the name of each element in
the second column of the above table, the symbol is given which
is always employed to represent it. This symbol, however, not
only represents the particular element, but a certain definite
quantity of it. Thus, the letter H always stands for 1 atom or
1 part by weight of hydrogen, the letter N for 1 atom or 14 parts
of nitrogen, and the symbol Cl for 1 atom or 35.5 parts of chlorine.<a name="FnAnchor_8b" id="FnAnchor_8b" href="#Footnote_8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
Compounds are in like manner represented by writing the
symbols of their constituent elements side by side, and if more
than one atom of each element be present, the number is indicated
by a numeral placed on the right of the symbol of the element
either below or above the line. Thus, hydrochloric acid is
represented by the formula HCl, that is to say, it is a compound
of an atom of hydrogen with an atom of chlorine, or of 1 part
by weight of hydrogen with 35.5 parts by weight of chlorine;
again, sulphuric acid is represented by the formula H<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>, which
is a statement that it consists of 2 atoms of hydrogen, 1 of sulphur,
and 4 of oxygen, and consequently of certain relative weights of
these elements. A figure placed on the right of a symbol only
affects the symbol to which it is attached, but when figures are
placed in front of several symbols all are affected by it, thus
2H<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span> means H<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span> taken twice.</p>

<p>The distribution of weight in chemical change is readily
expressed in the form of equations by the aid of these symbols;
the equation</p>

<p class="center1">2HCl + Zn = ZnCl<span class="su">2</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">for example, is to be read as meaning that from 73 parts of
hydrochloric acid and 65 parts of zinc, 136 parts of zinc chloride
and 2 parts of hydrogen are produced. The + sign is invariably
employed in this way either to express combination or action
upon, the meaning usually attached to the use of the sign = being
that from such and such bodies such and such other bodies
are formed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span></p>

<p>Usually, when the symbols of the elements are written or
printed with a figure to the right, it is understood that this
indicates a molecule of the element, the symbol alone representing
an atom. Thus, the symbols H<span class="su">2</span> and P<span class="su">4</span> indicate that the molecules
of hydrogen and phosphorus respectively contain 2 and 4
atoms. Since, according to the molecular theory, in all cases
of chemical change the action is between molecules, such symbols
as these ought always to be employed. Thus, the formation of
hydrochloric acid from hydrogen and chlorine is correctly
represented by the equation</p>

<p class="center1">H<span class="su">2</span> + Cl<span class="su">2</span> = 2HCl;</p>

<p class="noind">that is to say, a molecule of hydrogen and a molecule of chlorine
give rise to two molecules of hydrochloric acid; whilst the
following equation merely represents the relative weights of the
elements which enter into reaction, and is not a complete expression
of what is supposed to take place:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">H + Cl = HCl.</p>

<p class="noind">In all cases it is usual to represent substances by formulae
which to the best of our knowledge express their molecular
composition in the state of gas, and not merely the relative
number of atoms which they contain; thus, acetic acid consists
of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion of one atom
of carbon, two of hydrogen, and one of oxygen, but its molecular
weight corresponds to the formula C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">2</span>, which therefore is
always employed to represent acetic acid. When chemical
change is expressed with the aid of molecular formulae not
only is the distribution of weight represented, but by the mere
inspection of the symbols it is possible to deduce from the law
of gaseous combination mentioned above, the relative volumes
which the agents and resultants occupy in the state of gas if
measured at the same temperature and under the same pressure.
Thus, the equation</p>

<p class="center1">2H<span class="su">2</span> + O<span class="su">2</span>= 2H<span class="su">2</span>O</p>

<p class="noind">not only represents that certain definite weights of hydrogen
and oxygen furnish a certain definite weight of the compound
which we term water, but that if the water in the state of gas,
the hydrogen and the oxygen are all measured at the same
temperature and pressure, the volume occupied by the oxygen
is only half that occupied by the hydrogen, whilst the resulting
water-gas will only occupy the same volume as the hydrogen.
In other words, 2 volumes of oxygen and 4 volumes of hydrogen
furnish 4 volumes of water-gas. A simple equation like this,
therefore, when properly interpreted, affords a large amount of
information. One other instance may be given; the equation</p>

<p class="center1">2NH<span class="su">3</span> = N<span class="su">2</span> + 3H<span class="su">2</span></p>

<p class="noind">represents the decomposition of ammonia gas into nitrogen and
hydrogen gases by the electric spark, and it not only conveys
the information that a certain relative weight of ammonia,
consisting of certain relative weights of hydrogen and nitrogen,
is broken up into certain relative weights of hydrogen and
nitrogen, but also that the nitrogen will be contained in half
the space which contained the ammonia, and that the volume
of the hydrogen will be one and a half times as great as that of
the original ammonia, so that in the decomposition of ammonia
the volume becomes doubled.</p>

<p>Formulae which merely express the relative number of atoms
of the different elements present in a compound are termed
<i>empirical formulae</i>, and the formulae of all compounds whose
molecular weights are undetermined are necessarily empirical.
The <i>molecular formula</i> of a compound, however, is always a
simple multiple of the empirical formula, if not identical with it;
thus, the empirical formula of acetic acid is CH<span class="su">2</span>O, and its
molecular formula is C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">2</span>, or twice CH<span class="su">2</span>O. In addition to
empirical and molecular formulae, chemists are in the habit of
employing various kinds of rational formulae, called structural,
constitutional or graphic formulae, &amp;c., which not only express
the molecular composition of the compounds to which they
apply, but also embody certain assumptions as to the manner
in which the constituent atoms are arranged, and convey more
or less information with regard to the nature of the compound
itself, viz. the class to which it belongs, the manner in which
it is formed, and the behaviour it will exhibit under various
circumstances. Before explaining these formulae it will be
necessary, however, to consider the differences in combining
power exhibited by the various elements.</p>

<p><i>Valency.</i>&mdash;It is found that the number of atoms of a given
element, of chlorine, for example, which unite with an atom of
each of the other elements is very variable. Thus, hydrogen
unites with but a single atom of chlorine, zinc with two, boron
with three, silicon with four, phosphorus with five and tungsten
with six. Those elements which are equivalent in combining
or displacing power to a single atom of hydrogen are said to be
<i>univalent</i> or <i>monad</i> elements; whilst those which are equivalent
to two atoms of hydrogen are termed bivalent or dyad elements;
and those equivalent to three, four, five or six atoms of hydrogen
triad, tetrad, pentad or hexad elements. But not only is the
combining power or valency (atomicity) of the elements different,
it is also observed that one element may combine with another
in several proportions, or that its valency may vary; for example,
phosphorus forms two chlorides represented by the formulae
PCl<span class="su">3</span> and PCl<span class="su">5</span>, nitrogen the series of oxides represented by the
formulae N<span class="su">2</span>O, NO, (N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>), N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span>, molybdenum forms the
chlorides MoCl<span class="su">2</span>, MoCl<span class="su">3</span>, MoCl<span class="su">4</span>, MoCl<span class="su">5</span>, MoCl<span class="su">6</span>(?), and tungsten
the chlorides WCl<span class="su">2</span>, WCl<span class="su">4</span>, WCl<span class="su">5</span>, WCl<span class="su">6</span>.</p>

<p>In explanation of these facts it is supposed that each element
has a certain number of &ldquo;units of affinity,&rdquo; which may be
entirely, or only in part, engaged when it enters into combination
with other elements; and in those cases in which the entire
number of units of affinity are not engaged by other elements,
it is supposed that those which are thus disengaged neutralize
each other, as it were. For example, in phosphorus pentachloride
the five units of affinity possessed by the phosphorus
atom are satisfied by the five monad atoms of chlorine, but in
the trichloride two are disengaged, and, it may be supposed,
satisfy each other. Compounds in which all the units of affinity
of the contained elements are engaged are said to be <i>saturated</i>,
whilst those in which the affinities of the contained elements are
not all engaged by other elements are said to be <i>unsaturated</i>.
According to this view, it is necessary to assume that, in all
unsaturated compounds, two, or some even number of affinities
are disengaged; and also that all elements which combine
with an even number of monad atoms cannot combine with an
odd number, and vice versa,&mdash;in other words, that the number
of units of affinity active in the case of any given element must
be always either an even or an odd number, and that it cannot
be at one time an even and at another an odd number. There
are, however, a few remarkable exceptions to this &ldquo;law.&rdquo;
Thus, it must be supposed that in nitric oxide, NO, an odd
number of affinities are disengaged, since a single atom of dyad
oxygen is united with a single atom of nitrogen, which in all its
compounds with other elements acts either as a triad or pentad.
When nitric peroxide, N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, is converted into gas, it decomposes,
and at about 180° C. its vapour entirely consists of molecules
of the composition NO<span class="su">2</span>; while at temperatures between this
and 0° C. it consists of a mixture in different proportions of the
two kinds of molecules, N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span> and NO<span class="su">2</span>. The oxide NO<span class="su">2</span> must
be regarded as another instance of a compound in which an odd
number of affinities of one of the contained elements are disengaged,
since it contains two atoms of dyad oxygen united with
a single atom of triad or pentad nitrogen. Again, when tungsten
hexachloride is converted into vapour it is decomposed into
chlorine and a pentachloride, having a normal vapour density,
but as in the majority of its compounds tungsten acts as a hexad,
we apparently must regard its pentachloride as a compound
in which an odd number of free affinities are disengaged. Hitherto
no explanation has been given of these exceptions to what
appears to be a law of almost universal application, viz. that the
sum of the units of affinity of all the atoms in a compound is
an even number.</p>

<p>The number of units of affinity active in the case of any
particular element is largely dependent, however, upon the
nature of the element or elements with which it is associated.
Thus, an atom of iodine only combines with one of hydrogen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
but may unite with three of chlorine, which never combines
with more than a single atom of hydrogen; an atom of phosphorus
unites with only three atoms of hydrogen, but with five
of chlorine, or with four of hydrogen and one of iodine; and the
chlorides corresponding to the higher oxides of lead, nickel,
manganese and arsenic, PbO<span class="su">2</span>, Ni<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, MnO<span class="su">2</span> and AS<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span> do not
exist as stable compounds, but the lower chlorides, PbCl<span class="su">2</span>, NiCl<span class="su">2</span>,
MnCl<span class="su">2</span> and AsCl<span class="su">3</span>, are very stable.</p>

<p>The valency of an element is usually expressed by dashes
or Roman numerals placed on the right of its symbol, thus:
H&prime;, O&prime;&prime;, B&prime;&prime;&prime;, C<span class="sp">IV</span>, P<span class="sp">V</span>, Mo<span class="sp">VI</span>; but in constructing graphic formulae
the symbols of the elements are written with as many lines
attached to each symbol as the element which it represents
has units of affinity.</p>

<p>The periodic law (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Element</a></span>) permits a grouping of the
elements according to their valency as follows:&mdash;Group O.:
helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon appear to be devoid of
valency. Group I.: the alkali metals Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and
also Ag, monovalent; Cu, monovalent and divalent; Au,
monovalent and trivalent. Group II.: the alkaline earth metals
Ca, Sr, Ba, and also Be (Gl), Mg, Zn, Cd, divalent; Hg, monovalent
and divalent. Group III.: B, trivalent; Al, trivalent, but
possibly also tetra- or penta-valent; Ga, divalent and trivalent;
In, mono-, di- and tri-valent; Tl, monovalent and trivalent.
Group IV.: C, Si, Ge, Zr, Th, tetravalent; Ti, tetravalent and
hexavalent; Sn, Pb, divalent and tetravalent; Ce, trivalent
and tetravalent. Group V.: N, trivalent and pentavalent, but
divalent in nitric oxide; P, As, Sb, Bi, trivalent and pentavalent,
the last being possibly divalent in BiO and BiCl<span class="su">2</span>. Group VI.:
O, usually divalent, but tetravalent and possibly hexavalent in
oxonium and other salts; S, Se, Te, di-, tetra- and hexa-valent;
Cr, di-, tri- and hexa-valent; Mo, W, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and
hexa-valent. Group VII.: H(?), monovalent; the halogens F,
Cl, Br, I, usually monovalent, but possibly also tri- and pentavalent;
Mn, divalent and trivalent, and possibly heptavalent
in permanganates. Group VIII.: Fe, Co, divalent and trivalent;
Ni, divalent; Os, Ru, hexavalent and octavalent; Pd, Pt,
divalent and tetravalent; Ir, tri-, tetra- and hexa-valent.
(See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Valency</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Constitutional Formulae.</i>&mdash;Graphic or constitutional formulae
are employed to express the manner in which the constituent
atoms of compounds are associated together; for example, the
trioxide of sulphur is usually regarded as a compound of an
atom of hexad sulphur with three atoms of dyad oxygen, and
this hypothesis is illustrated by the graphic formula</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:99px; height:40px" src="images/img42a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">When this oxide is brought into contact with water it combines
with it forming sulphuric acid, H<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>.</p>

<p>In this compound only two of the oxygen atoms are wholly
associated with the sulphur atom, each of the remaining oxygen
atoms being united by one of its affinities to the sulphur atoms,
and by the remaining affinity to an atom of hydrogen;
thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:136px; height:40px" src="images/img42b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">The graphic formula of a sulphate is readily deduced by remembering
that the hydrogen atoms are partially or entirely

and zinc sulphate have the formulae</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:528px; height:40px" src="images/img42c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Again, the reactions of acetic acid, C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">2</span>, show that the four
atoms of hydrogen which it contains have not all the same
function, and also that the two atoms of oxygen have different
functions; the graphic formula which we are led to assign to
acetic acid, viz.</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:146px; height:60px" src="images/img42d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">serves in a measure to express this, three of the atoms of hydrogen
being represented as associated with one of the atoms of carbon,
whilst the fourth atom is associated with an atom of oxygen
which is united by a single affinity to the second atom of carbon,
to which, however, the second atom of oxygen is united by both
of its affinities. It is not to be supposed that there are any
actual <i>bonds</i> of union between the atoms; graphic formulae
such as these merely express the hypothesis that certain of the
atoms in a compound come directly within the sphere of attraction
of certain other atoms, and only indirectly within the
sphere of attraction of others,&mdash;an hypothesis to which chemists
are led by observing that it is often possible to separate a group
of elements from a compound, and to displace it by other elements
or groups of elements.</p>

<p>Rational formulae of a much simpler description than these
graphic formulae are generally employed. For instance, sulphuric
acid is usually represented by the formula SO<span class="su">2</span>(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, which
indicates that it may be regarded as a compound of the group
SO<span class="su">2</span> with twice the group OH. Each of these OH groups is
equivalent in combining or displacing power to a monad element,
since it consists of an atom of dyad oxygen associated with a
single atom of monad hydrogen, so that in this case the SO<span class="su">2</span>
group is equivalent to an atom of a dyad element. This formula
for sulphuric acid, however, merely represents such facts as that
it is possible to displace an atom of hydrogen and an atom of
oxygen in sulphuric acid by a single atom of chlorine, thus
forming the compound SO<span class="su">3</span>HCl; and that by the action of
water on the compound SO<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span> twice the group OH, or water
minus an atom of hydrogen, is introduced in place of the two
monad atoms of chlorine&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">SO<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span> + 2HOH =  SO<span class="su">2</span>(OH)<span class="su">2</span> + 2HCl.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Water.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sulphuric acid.</p>

<p class="noind">Constitutional formulae like these, in fact, are nothing more
than symbolic expressions of the character of the compounds
which they represent, the arrangement of symbols in a certain
definite manner being understood to convey certain information
with regard to the compounds represented.</p>

<p>Groups of two or more atoms like SO<span class="su">2</span> and OH, which are
capable of playing the part of elementary atoms (that is to say,
which can be transferred from compound to compound), are
termed compound radicals, the elementary atoms being simple
radicals. Thus, the atom of hydrogen is a monad simple radical,
the atom of oxygen a dyad simple radical, whilst the group OH
is a monad compound radical.</p>

<p>It is often convenient to regard compounds as formed upon
certain types; alcohol, for example, may be said to be a compound
formed upon the water type, that is to say, a compound
formed from water by displacing one of the atoms of hydrogen
by the group of elements C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">Constitutional formulae become of preponderating importance
when we consider the more complicated inorganic and especially
organic compounds. Their full significance is treated in the

<p><i>Chemical Action.</i>&mdash;Chemical change or chemical action may
be said to take place whenever changes occur which involve an
alteration in the composition of molecules, and may be the
result of the action of agents such as heat, electricity or
light, or of two or more elements or compounds upon each
other.</p>

<p>Three kinds of changes are to be distinguished, viz. changes
which involve combination, changes which involve decomposition
or separation, and changes which involve at the same time
both decomposition and combination. Changes of the first and
second kind, according to our views of the constitution of molecules,
are probably of very rare occurrence; in fact, chemical
action appears almost always to involve the occurrence of both
these kinds of change, for, as already pointed out, we must
assume that the molecules of hydrogen, oxygen and several
other elements are diatomic, or that they consist of two atoms.
Indeed, it appears probable that with few exceptions the elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
are all compounds of similar atoms united together by one or
more units of affinity, according to their valencies. If this be
the case, however, it is evident that there is no real distinction
between the reactions which take place when two elements
combine together and when an element in a compound is displaced
by another. The combination, as it is ordinarily termed,
of chlorine with hydrogen, and the displacement of iodine in
potassium iodide by the action of chlorine, may be cited as
examples; if these reactions are represented, as such reactions
very commonly are, by equations which merely express the
relative weights of the bodies which, enter, into reaction, and of
the products, thus&mdash;</p>

<p>In all cases of chemical change energy in the form of heat is
either developed or absorbed, and the amount of heat developed
or absorbed in a given reaction is as definite as are the weights
of the substance engaged in the reaction. Thus, in the production
of hydrochloric acid from hydrogen and chlorine 22,000 calories
are developed; in the production of hydrobromic acid from
hydrogen and bromine, however, only 8440 calories are developed;
and in the formation of hydriodic acid from hydrogen and
iodine 6040 calories are absorbed.</p>

<p>This difference in behaviour of the three elements, chlorine,
bromine and iodine, which in many respects exhibit considerable
resemblance, may be explained in the following manner. We
may suppose that in the formation of gaseous hydrochloric acid
from gaseous chlorine and hydrogen, according to the equation</p>

<p class="center1">H<span class="su">2</span> + Cl<span class="su">2</span> = HCl + HCl,</p>

<p class="noind">a certain amount of energy is expended in separating the atoms
of hydrogen in the hydrogen molecule, and the atoms of chlorine
in the chlorine molecule, from each other; but that heat is
developed by the combination of the hydrogen atoms with
the chlorine atoms, and that, as more energy is developed by the
union of the atoms of hydrogen and chlorine than is expended
in separating the hydrogen atoms from each other and the
chlorine atoms from one another, the result of the action of the
two elements upon each other is the development of heat,&mdash;the
amount finally developed in the reaction being the difference
between that absorbed in decomposing the elementary molecules
and that developed by the combination of the atoms of
chlorine and hydrogen. In the formation of gaseous hydrobromic
acid from liquid bromine and gaseous hydrogen&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">H<span class="su">2</span> + Br<span class="su">2</span> = HBr + HBr,</p>

<p class="noind">in addition to the energy expended in decomposing the hydrogen
and bromine molecules, energy is also expended in converting
the liquid bromine into the gaseous condition, and probably
less heat is developed by the combination of bromine and
hydrogen than by the combination of chlorine and hydrogen, so
that the amount of heat finally, developed is much less than is
developed in the formation of hydrochloric acid. Lastly, in
the production of gaseous hydriodic acid from hydrogen and
solid iodine&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">H<span class="su">2</span> + I<span class="su">2</span> = HI + HI,</p>

<p class="noind">so much energy is expended in the decomposition of the hydrogen
and iodine molecules and in the conversion of the iodine into the
gaseous condition, that the heat which it may be supposed is
developed by the combination of the hydrogen and iodine atoms
is insufficient to balance the expenditure, and the final result is
therefore negative; hence it is necessary in forming hydriodic
acid from its elements to apply heat continuously.</p>

<p>These compounds also afford examples of the fact that,
generally speaking, those compounds are most readily formed,
and are most stable, in the formation of which the most heat is
developed. Thus, chlorine enters into reaction with hydrogen,
and removes hydrogen from hydrogenized bodies, far more
readily than bromine; and hydrochloric acid is a far more
stable substance than hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid being
greatly inferior even to hydrobromic acid in stability. Compounds
formed with the evolution of heat are termed exothermic,
while those formed with an absorption are termed endothermic.
Explosives are the commonest examples of endothermic compounds.</p>

<p>When two substances which by their action upon each other
develop much heat enter into reaction, the reaction is usually
complete without the employment of an excess of either; for
example, when a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, in the proportions
to form water&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">2H<span class="su">2</span> + O<span class="su">2</span> = 2OH<span class="su">2</span>,</p>

<p class="noind">is exploded, it is entirely converted into water. This is also
the case if two substances are brought together in solution, by
the action of which upon each other a third body is formed
which is insoluble in the solvent employed, and which also does
not tend to react upon any of the substances present; for
instance, when a solution of a chloride is added to a solution of
a silver salt, insoluble silver chloride is precipitated, and almost
the whole of the silver is removed from solution, even if the
amount of the chloride employed be not in excess of that
theoretically required.</p>

<p>But if there be no tendency to form an insoluble compound,
Or one which is not liable to react upon any of the other substances
present, this is no longer the case. For example, when a solution
of a ferric salt is added to a solution of potassium thiocyanate,
a deep red coloration is produced, owing to the formation of
ferric thiocyanate. Theoretically the reaction takes place in
the case of ferric nitrate in the manner represented by the
equation</p>

<p class="noind">but it is found that even when more than sixty times the amount
of potassium thiocyanate required by this equation is added,
a portion of the ferric nitrate still remains unconverted, doubtless
owing to the occurrence of the reverse change&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">In this, as in most other cases in which substances act upon one
another under such circumstances that the resulting compounds
are free to react, the extent to which the different kinds of action
which may occur take place is dependent upon the mass of the
substances present in the mixture. As another instance of this
kind, the decomposition of bismuth chloride by water may be
cited. If a very large quantity of water be added, the chloride
is entirely decomposed in the manner represented by the
equation&mdash;</p>

of water be added the decomposition is incomplete, and it is
found that the extent to which decomposition takes place is
proportional to the quantity of water employed, the decomposition
being incomplete, except in presence of large quantities
of water, because of the occurrence of the reverse action&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1">BiOCl + 2HCl = BiCl<span class="su">3</span> + OH<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p>Chemical change which merely involves simple decomposition
is thus seen to be influenced by the masses of the reacting substances
and the presence of the products of decomposition; in
other words the system of reacting substances and resultants
form a mixture in which chemical action has apparently ceased,
or the system is in equilibrium. Such reactions are termed
reversible (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chemical Action</a></span>).

<p class="center1 sc">III. Inorganic Chemistry</p>

<p>Inorganic chemistry is concerned with the descriptive study
of the elements and their compounds, except those of carbon.
Reference should be made to the separate articles on the different
elements and the more important compounds for their preparation,
properties and uses. In this article the development of
this branch of the science is treated historically.</p>

<p>The earliest discoveries in inorganic chemistry are to be found
in the metallurgy, medicine and chemical arts of the ancients.
The Egyptians obtained silver, iron, copper, lead, zinc and tin,
either pure or as alloys, by smelting the ores; mercury is mentioned
by Theophrastus (c. 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>). The manufacture of glass,
also practised in Egypt, demanded a knowledge of sodium or
potassium carbonates; the former occurs as an efflorescence
on the shores of certain lakes; the latter was obtained from
wood ashes. Many substances were used as pigments: Pliny
records white lead, cinnabar, verdigris and red oxide of iron;
and the preparation of coloured glasses and enamels testifies to
the uses to which these and other substances were put. Salts of
ammonium were also known; while alum was used as a mordant
in dyeing. Many substances were employed in ancient medicine:
galena was the basis of a valuable Egyptian cosmetic and drug;
the arsenic sulphides, realgar and orpiment, litharge, alum,
saltpetre, iron rust were also used. Among the Arabian and
later alchemists we find attempts made to collate compounds by
specific properties, and it is to these writers that we are mainly
indebted for such terms as &ldquo;alkali,&rdquo; &ldquo;sal,&rdquo; &amp;c. The mineral
acids, hydrochloric, nitric and sulphuric acids, and also <i>aqua
regia</i> (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) were discovered,
and the vitriols, alum, saltpetre, sal-ammoniac, ammonium
carbonate, silver nitrate (<i>lunar caustic</i>) became better known.
The compounds of mercury attracted considerable attention,
mainly on account of their medicinal properties; mercuric
oxide and corrosive sublimate were known to pseudo-Geber, and
the nitrate and basic sulphate to &ldquo;Basil Valentine.&rdquo; Antimony
and its compounds formed the subject of an elaborate treatise
ascribed to this last writer, who also contributed to our knowledge
of the compounds of zinc, bismuth and arsenic. All the commonly
occurring elements and compounds appear to have
received notice by the alchemists; but the writings assigned
to the alchemical period are generally so vague and indefinite
that it is difficult to determine the true value of the results
obtained.</p>

<p>In the succeeding iatrochemical period, the methods of the
alchemists were improved and new ones devised. Glauber
showed how to prepare hydrochloric acid, <i>spiritus salis</i>, by
heating rock-salt with sulphuric acid, the method in common
use to-day; and also nitric acid from saltpetre and arsenic
trioxide. Libavius obtained sulphuric acid from many substances,
<i>e.g.</i> alum, vitriol, sulphur and nitric acid, by distillation.
The action of these acids on many metals was also studied;
Glauber obtained zinc, stannic, arsenious and cuprous chlorides
by dissolving the metals in hydrochloric acid, compounds
hitherto obtained by heating the metals with corrosive sublimate,
and consequently supposed to contain mercury. The scientific
study of salts dates from this period, especial interest being
taken in those compounds which possessed a medicinal or
technical value. In particular, the salts of potassium, sodium
and ammonium were carefully investigated, but sodium and
potassium salts were rarely differentiated.<a name="FnAnchor_9b" id="FnAnchor_9b" href="#Footnote_9b"><span class="sp">9</span></a> The metals of the
alkaline-earths were somewhat neglected; we find Georg
Agricola considering gypsum (calcium sulphate) as a compound
of lime, while calcium nitrate and chloride became known at
about the beginning of the 17th century. Antimonial, bismuth
and arsenical compounds were assiduously studied, a direct
consequence of their high medicinal importance; mercurial
and silver compounds were investigated for the same reason.
The general tendency of this period appears to have taken the
form of improving and developing the methods of the alchemists;
few new fields were opened, and apart from a more complete
knowledge of the nature of salts, no valuable generalizations
were attained.</p>

<p>The discovery of phosphorus by Brand, a Hamburg alchemist,
in 1669 excited chemists to an unwonted degree; it was also
independently prepared by Robert Boyle and J. Kunckel,
Brand having kept his process secret. Towards the middle of
the 18th century two new elements were isolated: cobalt by
G. Brandt in 1742, and nickel by A.F. Cronstedt in 1750. These
discoveries were followed by Daniel Rutherford&rsquo;s isolation of
nitrogen in 1772, and by K. Scheele&rsquo;s isolation of chlorine and
oxygen in 1774 (J. Priestley discovered oxygen independently
at about the same time), and his investigation of molybdic and
tungstic acids in the following year; metallic molybdenum
was obtained by P.J. Hjelm in 1783, and tungsten by Don
Fausto d&rsquo;Elhuyar; manganese was isolated by J.G. Gahn in
1774. In 1784 Henry Cavendish thoroughly examined hydrogen,
establishing its elementary nature; and he made the far-reaching
discovery that water was composed of two volumes of hydrogen
to one of oxygen.</p>

<p>The phlogistic theory, which pervaded the chemical doctrine
of this period, gave rise to continued study of the products of
calcination and combustion; it thus happened that the knowledge
of oxides and oxidation products was considerably
developed. The synthesis of nitric acid by passing electric
sparks through moist air by Cavendish is a famous piece of
experimental work, for in the first place it determined the
composition of this important substance, and in the second
place the minute residue of air which would not combine, although
ignored for about a century, was subsequently examined by
Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay, who showed that it
consists of a mixture of elementary substances&mdash;argon, krypton,
neon and xenon (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Argon</a></span>).</p>

<p>The 18th century witnessed striking developments in
pneumatic chemistry, or the chemistry of gases, which had
been begun by van Helmont, Mayow, Hales and Boyle. Gases
formerly considered to be identical came to be clearly
distinguished, and many new ones were discovered. Atmospheric
air was carefully investigated by Cavendish, who showed that
it consisted of two elementary constituents: nitrogen, which
was isolated by Rutherford in 1772, and oxygen, isolated in
1774; and Black established the presence, in minute quantity,
of carbon dioxide (van Helmont&rsquo;s <i>gas sylvestre</i>). Of the many
workers in this field, Priestley occupies an important position.
A masterly device, initiated by him, was to collect gases over
mercury instead of water; this enabled him to obtain gases
previously only known in solution, such as ammonia, hydrochloric
acid, silicon fluoride and sulphur dioxide. Sulphuretted
hydrogen and nitric oxide were discovered at about the
same time.</p>

<p>Returning to the history of the discovery of the elements and
their more important inorganic compounds, we come in 1789 to
M.H. Klaproth&rsquo;s detection of a previously unknown constituent
of the mineral pitchblende. He extracted a substance to which
he assigned the character of an element, naming it uranium
(from <span class="grk" title="Ouranos">&#927;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span>, heaven); but it was afterwards shown by E.M.
Péligot, who prepared the pure metal, that Klaproth&rsquo;s product
was really an oxide. This element was investigated at a later
date by Sir Henry Roscoe, and more thoroughly and successfully
by C. Zimmermann and Alibegoff. Pitchblende attained considerable
notoriety towards the end of the 19th century on
account of two important discoveries. The first, made by Sir
William Ramsay in 1896, was that the mineral evolved a peculiar
gas when treated with sulphuric acid; this gas, helium (<i>q.v.</i>),
proved to be identical with a constituent of the sun&rsquo;s atmosphere,
detected as early as 1868 by Sir Norman Lockyer during a
spectroscopic examination of the sun&rsquo;s chromosphere. The
second discovery, associated with the Curies, is that of the
peculiar properties exhibited by the impure substance, and due
to a constituent named radium. The investigation of this
substance and its properties (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Radioactivity</a></span>) has proceeded
so far as to render it probable that the theory of the unalterability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
of elements, and also the hitherto accepted explanations of
various celestial phenomena&mdash;the source of solar energy and
the appearances of the tails of comets&mdash;may require recasting.</p>

<p>In the same year as Klaproth detected uranium, he also
isolated zirconia or zirconium oxide from the mineral variously
known as zircon, hyacinth, jacynth and jargoon; but he failed
to obtain the metal, this being first accomplished some years
later by Berzelius, who decomposed the double potassium
zirconium fluoride with potassium. In the following year, 1795,
Klaproth announced the discovery of a third new element,
titanium; its isolation (in a very impure form), as in the case of
zirconium, was reserved for Berzelius.</p>

<p>Passing over the discovery of carbon disulphide by W.A.
Lampadius in 1796, of chromium by L.N. Vauquelin in 1797, and
Klaproth&rsquo;s investigation of tellurium in 1798, the next important
series of observations was concerned with platinum and the
allied metals. Platinum had been described by Antonio de Ulloa
in 1748, and subsequently discussed by H.T. Scheffer in 1752.
In 1803 W.H. Wollaston discovered palladium, especially
interesting for its striking property of absorbing (&ldquo;occluding&rdquo;)
as much as 376 volumes of hydrogen at ordinary temperatures,
and 643 volumes at 90°. In the following year he discovered
rhodium; and at about the same time Smithson Tennant added
two more to the list&mdash;iridium and osmium; the former was
so named from the changing tints of its oxides (<span class="grk" title="iris">&#8146;&#961;&#953;&#962;</span>, rainbow),
and the latter from the odour of its oxide (<span class="grk" title="osmê">&#8000;&#963;&#956;&#942;</span>, smell). The
most recently discovered &ldquo;platinum metal,&rdquo; ruthenium,
was recognized by C.E. Claus in 1845. The great number
and striking character of the compounds of this group of
metals have formed the subject of many investigations, and
already there is a most voluminous literature. Berzelius was
an early worker in this field; he was succeeded by Bunsen,
and Deville and Debray, who worked out the separation of
rhodium; and at a later date by P.T. Cleve, the first to make
a really thorough study of these elements and their compounds.
Of especial note are the curious compounds formed by the union
of carbon monoxide with platinous chloride, discovered by Paul
Schützenberger and subsequently investigated by F.B. Mylius
and F. Foerster and by Pullinger; the phosphoplatinic compounds
formed primarily from platinum and phosphorus pentachloride;
and also the &ldquo;ammino&rdquo; compounds, formed by the
union of ammonia with the chloride, &amp;c., of these metals, which
have been studied by many chemists, especially S.M. Jörgensen.
Considerable uncertainty existed as to the atomic weights of
these metals, the values obtained by Berzelius being doubtful.
K.F.O. Seubert redetermined this constant for platinum,
osmium and iridium; E.H. Keiser for palladium, and A.A.
Joly for ruthenium.</p>

<p>The beginning of the 19th century witnessed the discovery
of certain powerful methods for the analysis of compounds and
the isolation of elements. Berzelius&rsquo;s investigation of the
action of the electric current on salts clearly demonstrated
the invaluable assistance that electrolysis could render to the
isolator of elements; and the adoption of this method by Sir
Humphry Davy for the analysis of the hydrates of the metals of
the alkalis and alkaline earths, and the results which he thus
achieved, established its potency. In 1808 Davy isolated
sodium and potassium; he then turned his attention to the
preparation of metallic calcium, barium, strontium and magnesium.
Here he met with greater difficulty, and it is to be
questioned whether he obtained any of these metals even in an
approximately pure form (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrometallurgy</a></span>). The
discovery of boron by Gay Lussac and Davy in 1809 led
Berzelius to investigate silica (<i>silex</i>). In the following year he
announced that silica was the oxide of a hitherto unrecognized
element, which he named <i>silicium</i>, considering it to be a metal.
This has proved to be erroneous; it is non-metallic in character,
and its name was altered to silicon, from analogy with carbon
and boron. At the same time Berzelius obtained the element,
in an impure condition, by fusing silica with charcoal and iron
in a blast furnace; its preparation in a pure condition he first
accomplished in 1823, when he invented the method of heating
double potassium fluorides with metallic potassium. The
success which attended his experiments in the case of silicon led
him to apply it to the isolation of other elements. In 1824 he
obtained zirconium from potassium zirconium fluoride; the
preparation of (impure) titanium quickly followed, and in 1828
he obtained thorium. A similar process, and equally efficacious,
was introduced by F. Wöhler in 1827. It consisted in heating
metallic chlorides with potassium, and was first applied to
aluminium, which was isolated in 1827; in the following year,
beryllium chloride was analysed by the same method, beryllium
oxide (berylla or glucina) having been known since 1798, when
it was detected by L. N. Vauquelin in the gem-stone beryl.</p>

<p>In 1812 B. Courtois isolated the element iodine from &ldquo;kelp,&rdquo;
the burnt ashes of marine plants. The chemical analogy of this
substance to chlorine was quickly perceived, especially after
its investigation by Davy and Gay Lussac. Cyanogen, a
compound which in combination behaved very similarly to
chlorine and iodine, was isolated in 1815 by Gay Lussac. This
discovery of the first of the then-styled &ldquo;compound radicals&rdquo;
exerted great influence on the prevailing views of chemical
composition. Hydrochloric acid was carefully investigated
at about this time by Davy, Faraday and Gay Lussac, its
composition and the elementary nature of chlorine being thereby
established.</p>

<p>In 1817 F. Stromeyer detected a new metallic element, cadmium,
in certain zinc ores; it was rediscovered at subsequent
dates by other observers and its chemical resemblance to zinc
noticed. In the same year Berzelius discovered selenium in a
deposit from sulphuric acid chambers, his masterly investigation
including a study of the hydride, oxides and other compounds.
Selenic acid was discovered by E. Mitscherlich, who also observed
the similarity of the crystallographic characters of selenates
and sulphates, which afforded valuable corroboration of his doctrine
of isomorphism. More recent and elaborate investigations
in this direction by A.E.H. Tutton have confirmed this view.</p>

<p>In 1818 L.J. Thénard discovered hydrogen dioxide, one of
the most interesting inorganic compounds known, which has
since been carefully investigated by H.E. Schöne, M. Traube,
Wolfenstein and others. About the same time, J.A. Arfvedson,
a pupil of Berzelius, detected a new element, which he named
lithium, in various minerals&mdash;notably petalite. Although
unable to isolate the metal, he recognized its analogy to sodium
and potassium; this was confirmed by R. Bunsen and A.
Matthiessen in 1855, who obtained the metal by electrolysis
and thoroughly examined it and its compounds. Its crimson
flame-coloration was observed by C.G. Gmelin in 1818.</p>

<p>The discovery of bromine in 1826 by A.J. Balard completed
for many years Berzelius&rsquo;s group of &ldquo;halogen&rdquo; elements; the
remaining member, fluorine, notwithstanding many attempts,
remained unisolated until 1886, when Henri Moissan obtained
it by the electrolysis of potassium fluoride dissolved in hydrofluoric
acid. Hydrobromic and hydriodic acids were investigated
by Gay Lussac and Balard, while hydrofluoric acid received
considerable attention at the hands of Gay Lussac, Thénard
and Berzelius. We may, in fact, consider that the descriptive
study of the various halogen compounds dates from about this
time. Balard discovered chlorine monoxide in 1834, investigating
its properties and reactions; and his observations on hypochlorous
acid and hypochlorites led him to conclude that &ldquo;bleaching-powder&rdquo;
or &ldquo;chloride of lime&rdquo; was a compound or mixture
in equimolecular proportions of calcium chloride and hypochlorite,
with a little calcium hydrate. Gay Lussac investigated
chloric acid; Stadion discovered perchloric acid, since more
fully studied by G.S. Serullas and Roscoe; Davy and Stadion
investigated chlorine peroxide, formed by treating potassium
chlorate with sulphuric acid. Davy also described and partially
investigated the gas, named by him &ldquo;euchlorine,&rdquo; obtained
by heating potassium chlorate with hydrochloric acid; this
gas has been more recently examined by Pebal. The oxy-acids
of iodine were investigated by Davy and H.G. Magnus; periodic
acid, discovered by the latter, is characterized by the striking
complexity of its salts as pointed out by Kimmins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
In 1830 N.G. Sefström definitely proved the existence of a
metallic element vanadium, which had been previously detected
(in 1801) in certain lead ores by A.M. del Rio; subsequent
elaborate researches by Sir Henry Roscoe showed many inaccuracies
in the conclusions of earlier workers (for instance, the
substance considered to be the pure element was in reality an
oxide) and provided science with an admirable account of this
element and its compounds. B.W. Gerland contributed to our
knowledge of vanadyl salts and the vanadic acids. Chemically
related to vanadium are the two elements tantalum and columbium
or niobium. These elements occur in the minerals columbite
and tantalite, and their compounds became known in the
early part of the 19th century by the labours of C. Hatchett,
A.G. Ekeberg, W.H. Wollaston and Berzelius. But the
knowledge was very imperfect; neither was it much clarified
by H. Rose, who regarded niobium oxide as the element. The
subject was revived in 1866 by C.W. Blomstrand and J.C.
Marignac, to whom is due the credit of first showing the true
chemical relations of these elements. Subsequent researches by
Sainte Claire Deville and L.J. Troost, and by A.G. Krüss and
L.E. Nilson, and subsequently (1904) by Hall, rendered notable
additions to our knowledge of these elements and their compounds.
Tantalum has in recent years been turned to economic service,
being employed, in the same manner as tungsten, for the production
of the filaments employed in incandescent electric
lighting.</p>

<p>In 1833 Thomas Graham, following the paths already traced
out by E.D. Clarke, Gay Lussac and Stromeyer, published his
masterly investigation of the various phosphoric acids and
their salts, obtaining results subsequently employed by J. von
Liebig in establishing the doctrine of the characterization and
basicity of acids. Both phosphoric and phosphorous acids
became known, although imperfectly, towards the end of the
18th century; phosphorous acid was first obtained pure by
Davy in 1812, while pure phosphorous oxide, the anhydride
of phosphorous acid, remained unknown until T.E. Thorpe&rsquo;s
investigation of the products of the slow combustion of phosphorus.
Of other phosphorus compounds we may here notice
Gengembre&rsquo;s discovery of phosphuretted hydrogen (phosphine)
in 1783, the analogy of which to ammonia was first pointed out
by Davy and supported at a later date by H. Rose; liquid
phosphuretted hydrogen was first obtained by Thénard in
1838; and hypophosphorous acid was discovered by Dulong
in 1816. Of the halogen compounds of phosphorus, the trichloride
was discovered by Gay Lussac and Thénard, while the
pentachloride was obtained by Davy. The oxychloride, bromides,
and other compounds were subsequently discovered;
here we need only notice Moissan&rsquo;s preparation of the trifluoride
and Thorpe&rsquo;s discovery of the pentafluoride, a compound of
especial note, for it volatilizes unchanged, giving a vapour of
normal density and so demonstrating the stability of a pentavalent
phosphorus compound (the pentachloride and pentabromide
dissociate into a molecule of the halogen element and phosphorus
trichloride).</p>

<p>In 1840 C.F. Schönbein investigated ozone, a gas of peculiar
odour (named from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="ozein">&#8004;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to smell) observed in 1785 by
Martin van Marum to be formed by the action of a silent electric
discharge on the oxygen of the air; he showed it to be an
allotropic modification of oxygen, a view subsequently confirmed
by Marignac, Andrews and Soret. In 1845 a further contribution
to the study of allotropy was made by Anton Schrötter, who
investigated the transformations of yellow and red phosphorus,
phenomena previously noticed by Berzelius, the inventor Of the
term &ldquo;allotropy.&rdquo; The preparation of crystalline boron in 1856
by Wöhler and Sainte Claire Deville showed that this element
also existed in allotropic forms, amorphous boron having been
obtained simultaneously and independently in 1809 by Gay
Lussac and Davy. Before leaving this phase of inorganic
chemistry, we may mention other historical examples of allotropy.
Of great importance is the chemical identity of the
diamond, graphite and charcoal, a fact demonstrated in part by
Lavoisier in 1773, Smithson Tennant in 1706, and by Sir George
Steuart-Mackenzie (1780-1848), who showed that equal weights
of these three substances yielded the same weight of carbon
dioxide on combustion. The allotropy of selenium was first
investigated by Berzelius; and more fully in 1851 by J.W.
Hittorf, who carefully investigated the effects produced by heat;
crystalline selenium possesses a very striking property, viz.
when exposed to the action of light its electric conductivity
increases. Another element occurring in allotropic forms is
sulphur, of which many forms have been described. E. Mitscherlich
was an early worker in this field. A modification
known as &ldquo;black sulphur,&rdquo; soluble in water, was announced
by F.L. Knapp in 1848, and a colloidal modification was
described by H. Debus. The dynamical equilibrium between
rhombic, liquid and monosymmetric sulphur has been worked
out by H.W. Bakhuis Roozeboom. The phenomenon of allotropy
is not confined to the non-metals, for evidence has been
advanced to show that allotropy is far commoner than hitherto
supposed. Thus the researches of Carey Lea, E.A. Schneider
and others, have proved the existence of &ldquo;colloidal silver&rdquo;;
similar forms of the metals gold, copper, and of the platinum
metals have been described. The allotropy of arsenic and
antimony is also worthy of notice, but in the case of the first
element the variation is essentially non-metallic, closely resembling
that of phosphorus. The term allotropy has also been
applied to inorganic compounds, identical in composition, but
assuming different crystallographic forms. Mercuric oxide,
sulphide and iodide; arsenic trioxide; titanium dioxide and
silicon dioxide may be cited as examples.</p>

<p>The joint discovery in 1859 of the powerful method of spectrum
analysis (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spectroscopy</a></span>) by G.R. Kirchhoff and R.W.
Bunsen, and its application to the detection and the characterization
of elements when in a state of incandescence, rapidly led
to the discovery of many hitherto unknown elements. Within
two years of the invention the authors announced the discovery
of two metals, rubidium and caesium, closely allied to sodium,
potassium and lithium in properties, in the mineral lepidolite
and in the Dürkheim mineral water. In 1861 Sir William Crookes
detected thallium (named from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="thallos">&#952;&#940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, a green bud, on
account of a brilliant green line in its spectrum) in the selenious
mud of the sulphuric acid manufacture; the chemical affinities
of this element, on the one hand approximating to the metals
of the alkalis, and on the other hand to lead, were mainly
established by C.A. Lamy. Of other metals first detected by
the spectroscope mention is to be made of indium, determined
by F. Reich and H.T. Richter in 1863, and of gallium, detected
in certain zinc blendes by Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875. The
spectroscope has played an all-important part in the characterization
of the elements, which, in combination with oxygen,
constitute the group of substances collectively named the &ldquo;rare
earths.&rdquo; The substances occur, in very minute quantity, in a
large number of sparingly-distributed and comparatively rare
minerals&mdash;euxenite, samarksite, cerite, yttrotantalite, &amp;c.
Scandinavian specimens of these minerals were examined by
J. Gadolin, M.H. Klaproth, and especially by Berzelius; these
chemists are to be regarded as the pioneers in this branch of
descriptive chemistry. Since their day many chemists have
entered the lists, new and powerful methods of research have
been devised, and several new elements definitely characterized.
Our knowledge on many points, however, is very chaotic; great
uncertainty and conflict of evidence circulate around many of
the &ldquo;new elements&rdquo; which have been announced, so much so
that P.T. Cleve proposed to divide the &ldquo;rare earth&rdquo; metals into
two groups, (1) &ldquo;perfectly characterized&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;not yet
thoroughly characterized.&rdquo; The literature of this subject is
very large. The memorial address on J.C.G. de Marignac, a
noted worker in this field, delivered by Cleve, a high authority
on this subject, before the London Chemical Society (<i>J.C.S.
Trans.</i>, 1895, p. 468), and various papers in the same journal
by Sir William Crookes, Bohuslav Brauner and others should
be consulted for details.</p>

<p>In the separation of the constituents of the complex mixture
of oxides obtained from the &ldquo;rare earth&rdquo; minerals, the methods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
generally forced upon chemists are those of fractional precipitation
or crystallization; the striking resemblances of the compounds
of these elements rarely admitting of a complete separation
by simple precipitation and filtration. The extraordinary
patience requisite to a successful termination of such an analysis
can only be adequately realized by actual research; an idea
may be obtained from Crookes&rsquo;s <i>Select Methods in Analysis</i>.
Of recent years the introduction of various organic compounds as
precipitants or reagents has reduced the labour of the process;
and advantage has also been taken of the fairly complex double
salts which these metals form with compounds. The purity of
the compounds thus obtained is checked by spectroscopic
observations. Formerly the spark- and absorption-spectra
were the sole methods available; a third method was introduced
by Crookes, who submitted the oxides, or preferably the basic
sulphates, to the action of a negative electric discharge <i>in vacuo</i>,
and investigated the phosphorescence induced spectroscopically.
By such a study in the ultra-violet region of a fraction prepared
from crude yttria he detected a new element victorium, and
subsequently by elaborate fractionation obtained the element
itself.</p>

<p>The first earth of this group to be isolated (although in an
impure form) was yttria, obtained by Gadolin in 1794 from the
mineral gadolinite, which was named after its discoverer and
investigator. Klaproth and Vauquelin also investigated this
earth, but without detecting that it was a complex mixture&mdash;a
discovery reserved for C.G. Mosander. The next discovery,
made independently and simultaneously in 1803 by Klaproth and
by W. Hisinger and Berzelius, was of ceria, the oxide of cerium,
in the mineral cerite found at Ridderhytta, Westmannland,
Sweden. These crude earths, yttria and ceria, have supplied
most if not all of the &ldquo;rare earth&rdquo; metals. In 1841 Mosander,
having in 1839 discovered a new element lanthanum in the
mineral cerite, isolated this element and also a hitherto unrecognized
substance, didymia, from crude yttria, and two years
later he announced the determination of two fresh constituents
of the same earth, naming them erbia and terbia. Lanthanum
has retained its elementary character, but recent attempts at
separating it from didymia have led to the view that didymium
is a mixture of two elements, praseodymium and neodymium
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Didymium</a></span>). Mosander&rsquo;s erbia has been shown to contain
various other oxides&mdash;thulia, holmia, &amp;c.&mdash;but this has not yet
been perfectly worked out. In 1878 Marignac, having subjected
Mosander&rsquo;s erbia, obtained from gadolinite, to a careful examination,
announced the presence of a new element, ytterbium;
this discovery was confirmed by Nilson, who in the following year
discovered another element, scandium, in Marignac&rsquo;s ytterbia.
Scandium possesses great historical interest, for Cleve showed
that it was one of the elements predicted by Mendeléeff about ten
years previously from considerations based on his periodic
classification of the elements (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Element</a></span>). Other elements
predicted and characterized by Mendeléeff which have been
since realized are gallium, discovered in 1875, and germanium,
discovered in 1885 by Clemens Winkler.</p>

<p>In 1880 Marignac examined certain earths obtained from the
mineral samarskite, which had already in 1878 received attention
from Delafontaine and later from Lecoq de Boisbaudran. He
established the existence of two new elements, samarium and
gadolinium, since investigated more especially by Cleve, to whom
most of our knowledge on this subject is due. In addition to
the rare elements mentioned above, there are a score or so more
whose existence is doubtful. Every year is attended by fresh
&ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; in this prolific source of elementary substances,
but the paucity of materials and the predilections of the investigators
militate in some measure against a just valuation being
accorded to such researches. After having been somewhat
neglected for the greater attractions and wider field presented
by organic chemistry, the study of the elements
and their inorganic compounds is now rapidly coming into
favour; new investigators are continually entering the lists;
the beaten paths are being retravcrsed and new ramifications
pursued.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center1 sc">IV. Organic Chemistry</p>

<p>While inorganic chemistry was primarily developed through
the study of minerals&mdash;a connexion still shown by the French
appellation <i>chimie minérale</i>&mdash;organic chemistry owes its origin
to the investigation of substances occurring in the vegetable
and animal organisms. The quest of the alchemists for the
philosopher&rsquo;s stone, and the almost general adherence of the
iatrochemists to the study of the medicinal characters and
preparation of metallic compounds, stultified in some measure
the investigation of vegetable and animal products. It is true
that by the distillation of many herbs, resins and similar substances,
several organic compounds had been prepared, and in a
few cases employed as medicines; but the prevailing classification
of substances by physical and superficial properties led to
the correlation of organic and inorganic compounds, without
any attention being paid to their chemical composition. The
clarification and spirit of research so clearly emphasized by
Robert Boyle in the middle of the 17th century is reflected in
the classification of substances expounded by Nicolas Lémery,
in 1675, in his <i>Cours de chymie</i>. Taking as a basis the nature of
the source of compounds, he framed three classes: &ldquo;mineral,&rdquo;
comprising the metals, minerals, earths and stones; &ldquo;vegetable,&rdquo;
comprising plants, resins, gums, juices, &amp;c.; and
&ldquo;animal,&rdquo; comprising animals, their different parts and excreta.
Notwithstanding the inconsistency of his allocation of substances
to the different groups (for instance, acetic acid was placed in
the vegetable class, while the acetates and the products of their
dry distillation, acetone, &amp;c., were placed in the mineral class),
this classification came into favour. The phlogistonists endeavoured
to introduce chemical notions to support it: Becher,
in his <i>Physica subterranea</i>(1669), stated that mineral, vegetable
and animal matter contained the same elements, but that more
simple combinations prevailed in the mineral kingdom; while
Stahl, in his <i>Specimen Becherianum</i> (1702), held the &ldquo;earthy&rdquo;
principle to predominate in the mineral class, and the &ldquo;aqueous&rdquo;
and &ldquo;combustible&rdquo; in the vegetable and animal classes. It
thus happened that in the earlier treatises on phlogistic chemistry
organic substances were grouped with all combustibles.</p>

<p>The development of organic chemistry from this time until
almost the end of the 18th century was almost entirely confined
to such compounds as had practical applications, especially in
pharmacy and dyeing. A new and energetic spirit was introduced
by Scheele; among other discoveries this gifted experimenter
isolated and characterized many organic acids, and proved the
general occurrence of glycerin (<i>Ölsüss</i>) in all oils and fats.
Bergman worked in the same direction; while Rouelle was
attracted to the study of animal chemistry. Theoretical speculations
were revived by Lavoisier, who, having explained the nature
of combustion and determined methods for analysing compounds,
concluded that vegetable substances ordinarily contained
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, while animal substances generally
contained, in addition to these elements, nitrogen, and sometimes
phosphorus and sulphur. Lavoisier, to whom chemistry was
primarily the chemistry of oxygen compounds, having developed
the radical theory initiated by Guyton de Morveau, formulated
the hypothesis that vegetable and animal substances were oxides
of radicals composed of carbon and hydrogen; moreover, since
simple radicals (the elements) can form more than one oxide,
he attributed the same character to his hydrocarbon radicals:
he considered, for instance, sugar to be a neutral oxide and
oxalic acid a higher oxide of a certain radical, for, when oxidized
by nitric acid, sugar yields oxalic acid. At the same time, however,
he adhered to the classification of Lémery; and it was
only when identical compounds were obtained from both vegetable
and animal sources that this subdivision was discarded, and
the classes were assimilated in the division organic chemistry.</p>

<p>At this time there existed a belief, held at a later date by
Berzelius, Gmelin and many others, that the formation of
organic compounds was conditioned by a so-called <i>vital force</i>;
and the difficulty of artificially realizing this action explained
the supposed impossibility of synthesizing organic compounds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
This dogma was shaken by Wöhler&rsquo;s synthesis of urea in
1828. But the belief died hard; the synthesis of urea remained
isolated for many years; and many explanations were attempted
by the vitalists (as, for instance, that urea was halfway between
the inorganic and organic kingdoms, or that the carbon, from
which it was obtained, retained the essentials of this hypothetical
vital force), but only to succumb at a later date to the indubitable
fact that the same laws of chemical combination prevail in both
the animate and inanimate kingdoms, and that the artificial
or laboratory synthesis of any substance, either inorganic or
organic, is but a question of time, once its constitution is
determined.<a name="FnAnchor_10b" id="FnAnchor_10b" href="#Footnote_10b"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>The exact delimitation of inorganic and organic chemistry
engrossed many minds for many years; and on this point there
existed considerable divergence of opinion for several decades.
In addition to the vitalistic doctrine of the origin of organic
compounds, views based on purely chemical considerations were
advanced. The atomic theory, and its correlatives&mdash;the laws
of constant and multiple proportions&mdash;had been shown to possess
absolute validity so far as well-characterized inorganic compounds
were concerned; but it was open to question whether
organic compounds obeyed the same laws. Berzelius, in 1813
and 1814, by improved methods of analysis, established that
the Daltonian laws of combination held in both the inorganic
and organic kingdoms; and he adopted the view of Lavoisier
that organic compounds were oxides of compound radicals, and
therefore necessarily contained at least three elements&mdash;carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen. This view was accepted in 1817 by
Leopold Gmelin, who, in his <i>Handbuch der Chemie</i>, regarded
inorganic compounds as being of binary composition (the
simplest being oxides both acid and basic, which by combination
form salts also of binary form), and organic compounds as
ternary, <i>i.e.</i> composed of three elements; furthermore, he
concluded that inorganic compounds could be synthesized,
whereas organic compounds could not. A consequence of this
empirical division was that marsh gas, ethylene and cyanogen
were regarded as inorganic, and at a later date many other
hydrocarbons of undoubtedly organic nature had to be included
in the same division.</p>

<p>The binary conception of compounds held by Berzelius received
apparent support from the observations of Gay Lussac, in 1815,
on the vapour densities of alcohol and ether, which pointed to
the conclusion that these substances consisted of one molecule
of water and one and two of ethylene respectively; and from
Pierre Jean Robiquet and Jean Jacques Colin, showing, in 1816,
that ethyl chloride (hydrochloric ether) could be regarded as
a compound of ethylene and hydrochloric acid.<a name="FnAnchor_11b" id="FnAnchor_11b" href="#Footnote_11b"><span class="sp">11</span></a> Compound
radicals came to be regarded as the immediate constituents of
organic compounds; and, at first, a determination of their
empirical composition was supposed to be sufficient to characterize
them. To this problem there was added another in
about the third decade of the 19th century&mdash;namely, to determine
the manner in which the atoms composing the radical were
combined; this supplementary requisite was due to the discovery
of the isomerism of silver fulminate and silver cyanate
by Justus von Liebig in 1823, and to M. Faraday&rsquo;s discovery of
butylene, isomeric with ethylene, in 1825.</p>

<p>The classical investigation of Liebig and Friedrich Wohler
on the radical of benzoic acid (&ldquo;Über das Radikal der Benzoë-säure,&rdquo;
<i>Ann. Chem.</i>, 1832, 3, p. 249) is to be regarded as a most
important contribution to the radical theory, for it was shown
that a radical containing the elements carbon, hydrogen and
oxygen, which they named benzoyl (the termination <i>yl</i> coming
from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="ylê">&#8020;&#955;&#951;</span>, matter), formed the basis of benzaldehyde,
benzoic acid, benzoyl chloride, benzoyl bromide and benzoyl
sulphide, benzamide and benzoic ether. Berzelius immediately
appreciated the importance of this discovery, notwithstanding
that he was compelled to reject the theory that oxygen could
not play any part in a compound radical&mdash;a view which he
previously considered as axiomatic; and he suggested the
names &ldquo;proin&rdquo; or &ldquo;orthrin&rdquo; (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="prôi">&#960;&#961;&#969;&#943;</span> and <span class="grk" title="orthros">&#8000;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span>,
at dawn). However, in 1833, Berzelius reverted to his earlier
opinion that oxygenated radicals were incompatible with his
electrochemical theory; he regarded benzoyl as an oxide of the
radical C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>, which he named &ldquo;picramyl&rdquo; (from <span class="grk" title="pikros">&#960;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span>,
bitter, and <span class="grk" title="amygdalê">&#7936;&#956;&#965;&#947;&#948;&#940;&#955;&#951;</span>, almond), the peroxide being anhydrous
benzoic acid; and he dismissed the views of Gay Lussac and
Dumas that ethylene was the radical of ether, alcohol and ethyl
chloride, setting up in their place the idea that ether was a
suboxide of ethyl, (C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">2</span>O, which was analogous to K<span class="su">2</span>O, while
alcohol was an oxide of a radical C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">6</span>; thus annihilating any
relation between these two compounds. This view was modified
by Liebig, who regarded ether as ethyl oxide, and alcohol as the
hydrate of ethyl oxide; here, however, he was in error, for he
attributed to alcohol a molecular weight double its true value.
Notwithstanding these errors, the value of the &ldquo;ethyl theory&rdquo;
was perceived; other radicals&mdash;formyl, methyl, amyl, acetyl,
&amp;c.&mdash;were characterized; Dumas, in 1837, admitted the failure
of the etherin theory; and, in company with Liebig, he defined
organic chemistry as the &ldquo;chemistry of compound radicals.&rdquo;
The knowledge of compound radicals received further increment
at the hands of Robert W. Bunsen, the discoverer of the cacodyl
compounds.</p>

<p>The radical theory, essentially dualistic in nature in view of
its similarity to the electrochemical theory of Berzelius, was
destined to succumb to a unitary theory. Instances had already
been recorded of cases where a halogen element replaced hydrogen
with the production of a closely allied substance: Gay Lussac
had prepared cyanogen chloride from hydrocyanic acid; Faraday,
hexachlorethane from ethylene dichloride, &amp;c. Here the electro-negative
halogens exercised a function similar to electro-positive
hydrogen. Dumas gave especial attention to such substitutions,
named <i>metalepsy</i> <span class="grk" title="metalêpsis">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#953;&#962;</span>, exchange); and framed the
following empirical laws to explain the reactions:&mdash;(1) a body
containing hydrogen when substituted by a halogen loses one
atom of hydrogen for every atom of halogen introduced; (2) the
same holds if oxygen be present, except that when the oxygen
is present as water the latter first loses its hydrogen without
replacement, and then substitution according to (1) ensues.
Dumas went no further that thus epitomizing his observations;
and the next development was made in 1836 by Auguste Laurent,
who, having amplified and discussed the applicability of Dumas&rsquo;
views, promulgated his <i>Nucleus Theory</i>, which assumed the
existence of &ldquo;original nuclei or radicals&rdquo; (<i>radicaux</i> or <i>noyaux
fondamentaux</i>) composed of carbon and hydrogen, and &ldquo;derived
nuclei&rdquo; (<i>radicaux</i> or <i>noyaux dérivés</i>) formed from the original
nuclei by the substitution of hydrogen or the addition of other
elements, and having properties closely related to the primary
nuclei.</p>

<p>Vigorous opposition was made by Liebig and Berzelius, the
latter directing his attack against Dumas, whom he erroneously
believed to be the author of what was, in his opinion, a pernicious
theory. Dumas repudiated the accusation, affirming that he
held exactly contrary views to Laurent; but only to admit
their correctness in 1839, when, from his own researches and
those of Laurent, Malaguti and Regnault, he formulated his
<i>type theory</i>. According to this theory a &ldquo;chemical type&rdquo;
embraced compounds containing the same number of equivalents
combined in a like manner and exhibiting similar properties;
thus acetic and trichloracetic acids, aldehyde and chloral, marsh
gas and chloroform are pairs of compounds referable to the same
type. He also postulated, with Regnault, the existence of
&ldquo;molecular or mechanical types&rdquo; containing substances which,
although having the same number of equivalents, are essentially
different in characters. His unitary conceptions may be summarized:
every chemical compound forms a complete whole,
and cannot therefore consist of two parts; and its chemical
character depends primarily upon the arrangement and number
of the atoms, and, in a lesser degree, upon their chemical nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
More emphatic opposition to the dualistic theory of Berzelius
was hardly possible; this illustrious chemist perceived that the
validity of his electrochemical theory was called in question,
and therefore he waged vigorous war upon Dumas and his
followers. But he fought in a futile cause; to explain the facts
put forward by Dumas he had to invent intricate and involved
hypotheses, which, it must be said, did not meet with general
acceptance; Liebig seceded from him, and invited Wöhler to
endeavour to correct him. Still, till the last Berzelius remained
faithful to his original theory; experiment, which he had hitherto
held to be the only sure method of research, he discarded, and
in its place he substituted pure speculation, which greatly injured
the radical theory. At the same time, however, the conception
of radicals could not be entirely displaced, for the researches of
Liebig and Wohler, and those made subsequently by Bunsen,
demonstrated beyond all doubt the advantages which would
accrue from their correct recognition.</p>

<p>A step forward&mdash;the fusion of Dumas&rsquo;, type theory and the
radical theory&mdash;was made by Laurent and Charles Gerhardt.
As early as 1842, Gerhardt in his <i>Précis de chimie organique</i>
exhibited a marked leaning towards Dumas&rsquo; theory, and it is
without doubt that both Dumas and Laurent exercised considerable
influence on his views. Unwilling to discard the strictly
unitary views of these chemists, or to adopt the copulae theory
of Berzelius, he revived the notion of radicals in a new form.
According to Gerhardt, the process of substitution consisted
of the union of two <i>residues</i> to form a unitary whole; these
residues, previously termed &ldquo;compound radicals,&rdquo; are atomic
complexes which remain over from the interaction of two
compounds. Thus, he interpreted the interaction of benzene
and nitric acid as C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">6</span> + HNO<span class="su">3</span> = C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>NO<span class="su">2</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>O, the &ldquo;residues&rdquo;
of benzene being C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span> and H, and of nitric acid HO and NO<span class="su">2</span>.
Similarly he represented the reactions investigated by Liebig
and Wöhler on benzoyl compounds as double decompositions.</p>

<p>This rejuvenation of the notion of radicals rapidly gained
favour; and the complete fusion of the radical theory with the
theory of types was not long delayed. In 1849 C.A. Wurtz
discovered the amines or substituted ammonias, previously
predicted by Liebig; A.W. von Hofmann continued the investigation,
and established their recognition as ammonia in which
one or more hydrogen atoms had been replaced by hydrocarbon
radicals, thus formulating the &ldquo;ammonia type.&rdquo; In 1850
A.W. Williamson showed how alcohol and ether were to be
regarded as derived from water by substituting one or both
hydrogen atoms by the ethyl group; he derived acids and the
acid anhydrides from the same type; and from a comparison
of many inorganic and the simple organic compounds he concluded
that this notion of a &ldquo;water-type&rdquo; clarified, in no small
measure, the conception of the structure of compounds.</p>

<p>These conclusions were co-ordinated in Gerhardt&rsquo;s &ldquo;new
theory of types.&rdquo; Taking as types hydrogen, hydrochloric acid,
water and ammonia, he postulated that all organic compounds
were referable to these four forms: the hydrogen type included
hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones; the hydrochloric acid
type, the chlorides, bromides and iodides; the water type, the
alcohols, ethers, monobasic acids, acid anhydrides, and the
analogous sulphur compounds; and the ammonia type, the
amines, acid-amides, and the analogous phosphorus and arsenic
compounds. The recognition of the polybasicity of acids,
which followed from the researches of Thomas Graham and
Liebig, had caused Williamson to suggest that dibasic acids could
be referred to a double water type, the acid radical replacing an
atom of hydrogen in each water molecule; while his discovery
of tribasic formic ether, CH(OC<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">3</span>, in 1854 suggested a triple
water type. These views were extended by William Odling, and
adopted by Gerhardt, but with modifications of Williamson&rsquo;s
aspects. A further generalization was effected by August
Kekulé, who rejected the hydrochloric acid type as unnecessary,
and introduced the methane type and condensed mixed types.
Pointing out that condensed types can only be fused with a
radical replacing more than one atom of hydrogen, he laid the
foundation of the doctrine of valency, a doctrine of incalculable
service to the knowledge of the structure of chemical
compounds.</p>

<p>At about the same time Hermann Kolbe attempted a rehabilitation,
with certain modifications, of the dualistic conception
of Berzelius. He rejected the Berzelian tenet as to the
unalterability of radicals, and admitted that they exercised a
considerable influence upon the compounds with which they were
copulated. By his own investigations and those of Sir Edward
Frankland it was proved that the radical methyl existed in
acetic acid; and by the electrolysis of sodium acetate, Kolbe
concluded that he had isolated this radical; in this, however,
he was wrong, for he really obtained ethane, C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">6</span>, and not
methyl, CH<span class="su">3</span>. From similar investigations of valerianic acid
he was led to conclude that fatty acids were oxygen compounds
of the radicals hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, &amp;c., combined with the
double carbon equivalent C<span class="su">2</span>. Thus the radical of acetic acid,
acetyl,<a name="FnAnchor_12b" id="FnAnchor_12b" href="#Footnote_12b"><span class="sp">12</span></a> was C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">3</span>·C<span class="su">2</span>. (It will be noticed that Kolbe used the
atomic weights H=1, C=6, O=8, S=16, &amp;c.; his formulae,
however, were molecular formulae, <i>i.e.</i> the molecular weights
were the same as in use to-day.) This connecting link, C<span class="su">2</span>, was
regarded as essential, while the methyl, ethyl, &amp;c. was but a
sort of appendage; but Kolbe could not clearly conceive the
manner of copulation.</p>

<p>The brilliant researches of Frankland on the organo-metallic
compounds, and his consequent doctrine of saturation capacity
or valency of elements and radicals, relieved Kolbe&rsquo;s views of
all obscurity. The doctrine of copulae was discarded, and in
1859 emphasis was given to the view that all organic compounds
were derivatives of inorganic by simple substitution processes.
He was thus enabled to predict compounds then unknown,
<i>e.g.</i> the secondary and tertiary alcohols; and with inestimable
perspicacity he proved intimate relations between compounds
previously held to be quite distinct. Lactic acid and alanine
were shown to be oxy- and amino-propionic acids respectively;
glycollic acid and glycocoll, oxy- and amino-acetic acids; salicylic
and benzamic acids, oxy- and amino-benzoic acids.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the doctrine of valency was that it
permitted the graphic representation of the molecule. The
&ldquo;structure theory&rdquo; (or the mode of linking of the atoms) of
carbon compounds, founded by Butlerow, Kekulé and Couper
and, at a later date, marvellously enhanced by the doctrine of
stereo-isomerism, due to J.H. van&rsquo;t Hoff and Le Bel, occupies
such a position in organic chemistry that its value can never
be transcended. By its aid the molecule is represented as a
collection of atoms connected together by valencies in such a
manner that the part played by each atom is represented;
isomerism, or the existence of two or more chemically different
substances having identical molecular weights, is adequately
shown; and, most important of all, once the structure is
determined, the synthesis of the compound is but a matter of
time.</p>

<p>In this summary the leading factors which have contributed
to a correct appreciation of organic compounds have so far been
considered historically, but instead of continuing this method it
has been thought advisable to present an epitome of present-day
conclusions, not chronologically, but as exhibiting the principles
and subject-matter of our science.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Classification of Organic Compounds</i>.</p>

<p>An apt definition of organic chemistry is that it is &ldquo;the study
of the hydrocarbons and their derivatives.&rdquo; This description,
although not absolutely comprehensive, serves as a convenient
starting-point for a preliminary classification, since a great
number of substances, including the most important, are directly
referable to hydrocarbons, being formed by replacing one or
more hydrogen atoms by other atoms or groups. Two distinct
types of hydrocarbons exist: (1) those consisting of an open
chain of carbon atoms&mdash;named the &ldquo;aliphatic series&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="aleiphar">&#7940;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#966;&#945;&#961;</span>,
oil or fat), and (2) those consisting of a closed chain&mdash;the
&ldquo;carbocyclic series.&rdquo; The second series can be further divided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
into two groups: (1) those exhibiting properties closely analogous
to the aliphatic series&mdash;the polymethylenes (<i>q.v.</i>), and (2)
a series exhibiting properties differing in many respects from the
aliphatic and polymethylene compounds, and characterized by
a peculiar stability which is to be associated with the disposition
of certain carbon valencies not saturated by hydrogen&mdash;the
&ldquo;aromatic series.&rdquo; There also exists an extensive class of
compounds termed the &ldquo;heterocyclic series&rdquo;&mdash;these compounds
are derived from ring systems containing atoms other than
carbon; this class is more generally allied to the aromatic
series than to the aliphatic.</p>

<p>We now proceed to discuss the types of aliphatic compounds;
then, the characteristic groupings having been established, an
epitome of their derivatives will be given. Carbocyclic rings
will next be treated, benzene and its allies in some detail; and
finally the heterocyclic nuclei.</p>

<p>Accepting the doctrine of the tetravalency of carbon (its
divalency in such compounds as carbon monoxide, various
isocyanides, fulminic acid, &amp;c., and its possible trivalency in
M. Gomberg&rsquo;s triphenyl-methyl play no part in what follows),
it is readily seen that the simplest hydrocarbon has the formula
CH<span class="su">4</span> named methane, in which the hydrogen atoms are of
equal value, and which may be pictured as placed at the vertices
of a tetrahedron, the carbon atom occupying the centre. This
tetrahedral configuration is based on the existence of only one
methylene dichloride, two being necessary if the carbon valencies
were directed from the centre of a plane square to its corners,
and on the existence of two optical isomers of the formula
C.<i>A.B.D.E.</i>, C being a carbon atom and <i>A.B.D.E.</i> being different
monovalent atoms or radicals (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stereo-Isomerism</a></span>). The
equivalence of the four hydrogen atoms of methane rested on
indirect evidence, <i>e.g.</i> the existence of only one acetic acid,
methyl chloride, and other monosubstitution derivatives&mdash;until
the experimental proof by L. Henry (<i>Zeit. f. Phys. Chem.</i>, 1888,
2, p. 553), who prepared the four nitromethanes, CH<span class="su">3</span>NO<span class="su">2</span>, each
atom in methane being successively replaced by the nitro-group.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Henry started with methyl iodide, the formula of which we write
in the form CI<span class="su">a</span>H<span class="su">b</span>H<span class="su">c</span>H<span class="su">d</span>. This readily gave with silver nitrite a
nitromethane in which we may suppose the nitro-group to replace
the a <span class="correction" title="amended from hydrogen">iodine</span> atom, <i>i.e.</i> C(NO<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">a</span>H<span class="su">b</span>H<span class="su">c</span>H<span class="su">d</span>.  The same methyl iodide
gave with potassium cyanide, acetonitril, which was hydrolysed to
acetic acid; this must be C(COOH)<span class="su">a</span>H<span class="su">b</span>H<span class="su">c</span>H<span class="su">d</span>. Chlorination of this
substance gave a monochloracetic acid; we will assume the chlorine
atom to replace the b hydrogen atom. This acid with silver nitrite
gave nitroacetic acid, which readily gave the second nitromethane,
CH<span class="su">a</span>(NO<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">b</span>H<span class="su">c</span>H<span class="su">d</span> identical with the first nitromethane. From the
nitroacetic acid obtained above, malonic acid was prepared, and
from this a monochlormalonic acid was obtained; we assume the
chlorine atom to replace the c hydrogen atom. This acid gives with
silver nitrite the corresponding nitromalonic acid, which readily
yielded the third nitromethane, CH<span class="su">a</span>H<span class="su">b</span>(NO<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">c</span>H<span class="su">d</span>, also identical with
the first. The fourth nitromethane was obtained from the nitromalonic
acid previously mentioned by a repetition of the method
by which the third was prepared; this was identical with the other
three.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us now consider hydrocarbons containing 2 atoms of
carbon. Three such compounds are possible according to the
number of valencies acting directly between the carbon atoms.
Thus, if they are connected by one valency, and the remaining
valencies saturated by hydrogen, we obtain the compound
H<span class="su">3</span>C·CH<span class="su">3</span>, ethane. This compound may be considered as
derived from methane, CH<span class="su">4</span>, by replacing a hydrogen atom by
the monovalent group CH<span class="su">3</span>, known as <i>methyl</i>; hence ethane
may be named &ldquo;methylmethane.&rdquo; If the carbon atoms are
connected by two valencies, we obtain a compound H<span class="su">2</span>C:CH<span class="su">2</span>,
ethylene; if by three valencies, HC&#8758;CH, acetylene. These last
two compounds are termed <i>unsaturated</i>, whereas ethane is
<i>saturated</i>. It is obvious that we have derived three combinations
of carbon with hydrogen, characterized by containing a single,
double, and triple linkage; and from each of these, by the
substitution of a methyl group for a hydrogen atom, compounds
of the same nature result. Thus ethane gives H<span class="su">3</span>C·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>,
propane; ethylene gives H<span class="su">2</span>C:CH·CH<span class="su">3</span>, propylene; and acetylene
gives HC&#8758;C·CH<span class="su">3</span>, allylene. By continuing the introduction
of methyl groups we obtain three series of homologous hydro-carbons
given, by the general formulae C<span class="su">n</span>H<span class="su">2n+2</span>, C<span class="su">n</span>H<span class="su">2n</span>, and
C<span class="su">n</span>H<span class="su">2n-2</span>, each member differing from the preceding one of the
same series by CH<span class="su">2</span>. It will be noticed that compounds containing
two double linkages will have the same general formula as
the acetylene series; such compounds are known as the &ldquo;diolefines.&rdquo;
Hydrocarbons containing any number of double or
triple linkages, as well as both double and triple linkages, are
possible, and a considerable number of such compounds have
been prepared.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A more complete idea of the notion of a compound radical follows
from a consideration of the compound propane. We derived this
substance from ethane by introducing a methyl group; hence it
may be termed &ldquo;methylethane.&rdquo; Equally well we may derive it
from methane by replacing a hydrogen atom by the monovalent
group CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>, named ethyl; hence propane may be considered
as &ldquo;ethylmethane.&rdquo; Further, since methane may be regarded as
formed by the conjunction of a methyl group with a hydrogen atom,
it may be named &ldquo;methyl hydride&rdquo;; similarly ethane is &ldquo;ethyl
hydride,&rdquo; propane, &ldquo;propyl hydride,&rdquo; and so on. The importance
of such groups as methyl, ethyl, &amp;c. in attempting a nomenclature
of organic compounds cannot be overestimated; these compound
radicals, frequently termed <i>alkyl radicals</i>, serve a similar purpose to
the organic chemist as the elements to the inorganic chemist.</p>
</div>

<p>In methane and ethane the hydrogen atoms are of equal value,
and no matter which one may be substituted by another element
or group the same compound will result. In propane, on the
other hand, the hydrogen atoms attached to the terminal
carbon atoms differ from those joined to the medial atom; we
may therefore expect to obtain different compounds according
to the position of the hydrogen atom substituted. By introducing
a methyl group we may obtain CH<span class="su">3</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>,
known as &ldquo;normal&rdquo; or n-<i>butane,</i> substitution occurring at a
terminal atom, or CH<span class="su">3</span>·CH(CH<span class="su">3</span>)·CH<span class="su">3</span>, isobutane, substitution
occurring at the medial atom. From n-butane we may derive,
by a similar substitution of methyl groups, the two hydrocarbons:
(1) CH<span class="su">3</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>, and (2) CH<span class="su">3</span>·CH(CH<span class="su">3</span>)·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>;
from isobutane we may also derive two compounds, one identical
with (2.), and a new one (3) CH<span class="su">3</span>(CH<span class="su">3</span>)C(CH<span class="su">3</span>)CH<span class="su">3</span>. These
three hydrocarbons are <i>isomeric</i>, <i>i.e.</i> they possess the same
formula, but differ in constitution.  We notice that they may
be differentiated as follows: (1) is built up solely of methyl and
·CH2· (methylene) groups and the molecule consists of a single
chain; such hydrocarbons are referred to as being <i>normal</i>;
(2) has a branch and contains the group ÷CH (methine) in which
the free valencies are attached to carbon atoms; such hydrocarbons
are termed <i>secondary</i> or <i>iso</i>-; (3) is characterized by a
carbon atom linked directly to four other carbon atoms; such
hydrocarbons are known as <i>tertiary</i>.</p>

<p>Deferring the detailed discussion of cyclic or ringed hydrocarbons,
a correlation of the various types or classes of compounds
which may be derived from hydrocarbon nuclei will now be given.
It will be seen that each type depends upon a specific radical
or atom, and the copulation of this character with any hydrocarbon
radical (open or cyclic) gives origin to a compound of
the same class.</p>

<p>It is convenient first to consider the effect of introducing one,
two, or three hydroxyl (OH) groups into the -CH<span class="su">3</span>, >CH<span class="su">2</span>, and
->CH groups, which we have seen to characterize the different
types of hydrocarbons. It may be noticed here that cyclic
nuclei can only contain the groups >CH<span class="su">2</span> and ->CH, the first
characterizing the polymethylene and reduced heterocyclic
compounds, the second true aromatic compounds.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Substituting one hydroxyl group into each of these residues, we
obtain radicals of the type -CH<span class="su">2</span>·OH, >CH·OH, and ->C·OH;
these compounds are known as <i>alcohols</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), and are termed primary,
secondary, and tertiary respectively. Polymethylenes can give only
secondary and tertiary alcohols, benzene only tertiary; these latter
compounds are known as <i>phenols</i>.  A second hydroxyl group may be
introduced into the residues -CH<span class="su">2</span>·OH and >CH·OH, with the
production of radicals of the form -CH(OH)<span class="su">2</span> and >C(OH)<span class="su">2</span>.
Compounds containing these groupings are, however, rarely observed
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chloral</a></span>), and it is generally found that when compounds of
these types are expected, the elements of water are split off, and the
typical groupings are reduced to -CH:O and >C:O. Compounds
containing the group -CH:O are known as <i>aldehydes</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), while
the group >C:O (sometimes termed the carbonyl or keto group)
characterizes the <i>ketones</i> (<i>q.v.</i>). A third hydroxyl group may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
introduced into the -CH:O residue with the formation of the radical
-C(OH):O; this is known as the carboxyl group, and characterizes
the <i>organic</i> acids.</p>

<p>Sulphur analogues of these oxygen compounds are known. Thus
the thio-alcohols or <i>mercaptans</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) contain the group -CH<span class="su">2</span>·SH;
and the elimination of the elements of sulphuretted hydrogen
between two molecules of a thio-alcohol results in the formation of a
thio-ether or sulphide, R<span class="su">2</span>S. Oxidation of thio-ethers results in the
formation of sulphoxides, R<span class="su">2</span>:S:O, and sulphones, R<span class="su">2</span>:SO<span class="su">2</span>;
oxidation of mercaptans yields sulphonic acids, R·SO<span class="su">3</span>H, and of
sodium mercaptides sulphinic acids, R·SO(OH). We may also
notice that thio-ethers combine with alkyl iodides to form sulphine
or sulphonium compounds, R<span class="su">3</span>÷SI. Thio-aldehydes, thio-ketones
and thio-acids also exist.</p>
</div>

<p>We proceed to consider various simple derivatives of the
alcohols, which we may here regard as hydroxy hydrocarbons,
R·OH, where R is an alkyl radical, either aliphatic or cyclic in
nature.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Of these, undoubtedly the simplest are the <i>ethers</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), formed by
the elimination of the elements of water between two molecules of
the same alcohol, &ldquo;simple ethers,&rdquo; or of different alcohols, &ldquo;mixed
ethers.&rdquo; These compounds may be regarded as oxides in just the
same way as the alcohols are regarded as hydroxides. In fact, the
analogy between the alkyl groups and metallic elements forms a
convenient basis from which to consider many derivatives. Thus
from ethyl alcohol there can be prepared compounds, termed <i>esters</i>
(<i>q.v.</i>), or ethereal salts, exactly comparable in structure with corresponding
salts of, say, potassium; by the action of the phosphorus
haloids, the hydroxyl group is replaced by a halogen atom with the
formation of derivatives of the type R·Cl(Br,I); nitric acid forms
nitrates, R·O·NO<span class="su">2</span>; nitrous acid, nitrites, R·O·NO; sulphuric acid
gives normal sulphates R<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>, or acid sulphates, R·SO<span class="su">4</span>H. Organic
acids also condense with alcohols to form similar compounds: the
fats, waxes, and essential oils are naturally occurring substances of
this class.</p>

<p>An important class of compounds, termed <i>amines</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), results
from the condensation of alcohols with ammonia, water being
eliminated between the alcoholic hydroxyl group and a hydrogen
atom of the ammonia. Three types of amines are possible and have
been prepared: primary, R·NH<span class="su">2</span>; secondary, R<span class="su">2</span>:NH; and tertiary,
R<span class="su">3</span>÷N; the oxamines, R<span class="su">3</span>N:O, are closely related to the tertiary
ammonias, which also unite with a molecule of alkyl iodide to form
salts of quaternary ammonium bases, <i>e.g.</i> R<span class="su">4</span>N·I. It is worthy of
note that phosphorus and arsenic bases analogous to the amines
are known (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Phosphorus</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arsenic</a></span>). From the primary
amines are derived the diazo compounds (<i>q.v.</i>) and azo compounds
(<i>q.v.</i>); closely related are the hydrazines (<i>q.v.</i>). Secondary amines
yield nitrosamines, R<span class="su">2</span>N·NO, with nitrous acid. By the action of
hydroxylamine or phenylhydrazine on aldehydes or ketones, condensation
occurs between the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde or
ketone and the amino group of the hydroxylamine or hydrazine.
Thus with hydroxylamine aldehydes yield aldoximes, R·CH:N·OH,
and ketones, ketoximes, R<span class="su">2</span>C:N·OH (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oximes</a></span>), while phenyl
hydrazine gives phenylhydrazones, R<span class="su">2</span>C:N·NH·C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hydrazones</a></span>).
Oxyaldehydes and oxyketones (viz. compounds containing
an oxy in addition to an aldehydic or ketonic group) undergo
both condensation and oxidation when treated with phenylhydrazine,
forming compounds known as osozones; these are of great importance
in characterizing the sugars (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>The carboxyl group constitutes another convenient starting-point
for the orientation of many types of organic compounds.
This group may be considered as resulting from the fusion of a
carbonyl (:CO) and a hydroxyl (HO·) group; and we may
expect to meet with compounds bearing structural resemblances
to the derivatives of alcohols and aldehydes (or ketones).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Considering derivatives primarily concerned with transformations
of the hydroxyl group, we may regard our typical acid as a fusion
of a radical R·CO- (named acetyl, propionyl, butyl, &amp;c., generally
according to the name of the hydrocarbon containing the same
number of carbon atoms) and a hydroxyl group. By replacing the
hydroxyl group by a halogen, acid-haloids result; by the elimination
of the elements of water between two molecules, acid-anhydrides,
which may be oxidized to acid-peroxides; by replacing the hydroxyl
group by the group ·SH, thio-acids; by replacing it by the amino
group, acid-amides (<i>q.v.</i>); by replacing it by the group -NH·NH<span class="su">2</span>,
acid-hydrazides. The structural relations of these compounds are
here shown:</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="80%" summary="Contents">

<p>It is necessary clearly to distinguish such compounds as the
amino- (or amido-) acids and acid-amides; in the first case the
amino group is substituted in the hydrocarbon residue, in the second
it is substituted in the carboxyl group.</p>
</div>

<p>By transformations of the carbonyl group, and at the same time
of the hydroxyl group, many interesting types of nitrogen compounds
may be correlated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Thus from the acid-amides, which we have seen to be closely related
to the acids themselves, we obtain, by replacing the carbonyl oxygen
by chlorine, the acidamido-chlorides, R·CCl<span class="su">2</span>·NH<span class="su">2</span>, from which are
derived the imido-chlorides, R·CCl:NH, by loss of one molecule of
hydrochloric acid. By replacing the chlorine in the imido-chloride
by an oxyalkyl group we obtain the imido-ethers, R·C(OR&rsquo;):NH;
and by an amino group, the amidines, R·C(NH<span class="su">2</span>):NH. The
carbonyl oxygen may also be replaced by the oxime group, :N·OH;
thus the acids yield the hydroxamic acids, R·C(OH):NOH, and the
acid-amides the amidoximes, R·C(NH<span class="su">2</span>):NOH. Closely related to
the amidoximes are the nitrolic acids, R·C(NO<span class="su">2</span>):NOH.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Cyclic Hydrocarbons and Nuclei.</i></p>

<p>Having passed in rapid review the various types of compounds
derived by substituting for hydrogen various atoms or groups of
atoms in hydrocarbons (the separate articles on specific compounds
should be consulted for more detailed accounts), we now
proceed to consider the closed chain compounds. Here we meet
with a great diversity of types: oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and
other elements may, in addition to carbon, combine together in a
great number of arrangements to form cyclic nuclei, which
exhibit characters closely resembling open-chain compounds in
so far as they yield substitution derivatives, and behave as
compound radicals. In classifying closed chain compounds, the
first step consists in dividing them into: (1) <i>carbocyclic</i>, in which
the ring is composed solely of carbon atoms&mdash;these are also
known as <i>homocyclic</i> or <i>isocyclic</i> on account of the identity of
the members of the ring&mdash;and (2) <i>heterocyclic</i>, in which different
elements go to make up the ring. Two primary divisions of
carbocyclic compounds may be conveniently made: (1) those
in which the carbon atoms are completely saturated&mdash;these are
known by the generic term <i>polymethylenes</i>, their general formula
being (CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">n</span>: it will be noticed that they are isomeric with
ethylene and its homologues; they differ, however, from this
series in not containing a double linkage, but have a ringed
structure; and (2) those containing fewer hydrogen atoms than
suffice to saturate the carbon valencies&mdash;these are known as the
<i>aromatic compounds</i> proper, or as <i>benzene compounds</i>, from the
predominant part which benzene plays in their constitution.</p>

<p>It was long supposed that the simplest ring obtainable contained
six atoms of carbon, and the discovery of trimethylene
in 1882 by August Freund by the action of sodium on trimethylene
bromide, Br(CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">3</span>Br, came somewhat as a surprise, especially
in view of its behaviour with bromine and hydrogen bromide.
In comparison with the isomeric propylene, CH3·HC:CH2, it is
remarkably inert, being only very slowly attacked by bromine,
which readily combines with propylene. But on the other hand,
it is readily converted by hydrobromic acid into normal propyl
bromide, CH<span class="su">3</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>Br. The separation of carbon atoms
united by single affinities in this manner at the time the
observation was made was altogether without precedent. A similar
behaviour has since been noticed in other trimethylene derivatives,
but the fact that bromine, which usually acts so much
more readily than hydrobromic acid on unsaturated compounds,
should be so inert when hydrobromic acid acts readily is one still
needing a satisfactory explanation. A great impetus was given to
the study of polymethylene derivatives by the important and
unexpected observation made by W.H. Perkin, junr., in 1883,
that ethylene and trimethylene bromides are capable of acting
in such a way on sodium acetoacetic ester as to form tri- and
tetra-methylene rings. Perkin has himself contributed largely to our
knowledge of such compounds; penta- and hexa-methylene
derivatives have also received considerable attention (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polymethylenes</a></span>).</p>

<p>A. von Baeyer has sought to explain the variations in stability
manifest in the various polymethylene rings by a purely
mechanical hypothesis, the &ldquo;strain&rdquo; or <i>Spannungs</i> theory
(<i>Ber.</i>, 1885, p. 2277). Assuming the four valencies of the
carbon atom to be directed from the centre of a regular tetrahedron
towards its four corners, the angle at which they meet
is 109° 28&prime;. Baeyer supposes that in the formation of carbon
~52
&ldquo;rings&rdquo; the valencies become deflected from their positions, and
that the tension thus introduced may be deduced from a comparison
of this angle with the angles at which the strained
valencies would meet. He regards the amount of deflection as
a measure of the stability of the &ldquo;ring.&rdquo; The readiness with
which ethylene is acted on in comparison with other types of
hydrocarbon, for example, is in harmony, he considers, with
the circumstance that the greatest distortion must be involved
in its formation, as if deflected into parallelism each valency will
be drawn out of its position through &frac12;.109° 28&prime;. The values in
other cases are calculable from the formula &frac12;(1O9° 28&prime; - a), where
a is the internal angle of the regular polygon contained by sides
equal in number to the number of the carbon atoms composing
the ring. These values are:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>The general behaviour of the several types of hydrocarbons is
certainly in accordance with this conception, and it is a remarkable
fact that when benzene is reduced with hydriodic acid, it is
converted into a mixture of hexamethylene and methylpentamethylene
(cf. W. Markownikov, <i>Ann.</i>, 1898, 302, p. 1); and
many other cases of the conversion of six-carbon rings into five-carbon
rings have been recorded (see below, <i>Decompositions of
the Benzene Ring</i>). Similar considerations will apply to rings
containing other elements besides carbon. As an illustration it
may be pointed out that in the case of the two known types of
lactones&mdash;the &gamma;-lactones, which contain four carbon atoms and
one oxygen atom in the ring, are more readily formed and more
stable (less readily hydrolysed) than the &delta;-lactones, which
contain one oxygen and five carbon atoms in the ring. That the
number of atoms which can be associated in a ring by single
affinities is limited there can be no doubt, but there is not yet
sufficient evidence to show where the limit must be placed. Baeyer
has suggested that his hypothesis may also be applied to explain
the instability of acetylene and its derivatives, and the still
greater instability of the polyacetylene compounds.</p>


<p class="center1"><i>Benzene.</i></p>

<p>The ringed structure of benzene, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">6</span>, was first suggested in
1865 by August Kekulé, who represented the molecule by six
CH groups placed at the six angles of a regular hexagon, the sides
of which denoted the valencies saturated by adjacent carbon
atoms, the fourth valencies of each carbon atom being represented
as saturated along alternate sides. This formula, notwithstanding
many attempts at both disproving and modifying it, has well
stood the test of time; the subject has been the basis of constant
discussion, many variations have been proposed, but the original
conception of Kekulé remains quite as convenient as any of the
newer forms, especially when considering the syntheses and
decompositions of the benzene complex. It will be seen, however,
that the absolute disposition of the fourth valency may be
ignored in a great many cases, and consequently the complex may
be adequately represented as a hexagon. This symbol is in
general use; it is assumed that at each corner there is a CH
group which, however, is not always written in; if a hydrogen
atom be substituted by another group, then this group is
attached to the corner previously occupied by the displaced
hydrogen. The following diagrams illustrate these statements:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center1">
<img style="width:161px; height:50px" src="images/img52a.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="f80">Benzene.     Abbreviated.     Oxybenzene.   Abbreviated.</p>
</div>

<div class="condensed">
<p>From the benzene nucleus we can derive other aromatic nuclei,
graphically represented by fusing two or more hexagons along
common sides. By fusing two nuclei we obtain the formula of
naphthalene, C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">10</span>; by fusing three, the hydrocarbons anthracene
and phenanthrene, C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>; by fusing four, chrysene, C<span class="su">18</span>H<span class="su">12</span>, and
possibly pyrene, C<span class="su">16</span>H<span class="su">10</span>; by fusing five, picene, C<span class="su">22</span>H<span class="su">14</span>. But it
must be here understood that each member of these <i>condensed nuclei</i>
need not necessarily be identical in structure; thus the central
nuclei in anthracene and phenanthrene differ very considerably
from the terminal nuclei (see below, <i>Condensed Nuclei</i>). Other
hydrocarbon nuclei generally classed as aromatic in character result
from the union of two or more benzene nuclei joined by one or two
valencies with polymethylene or oxidized polymethylene rings;
instances of such nuclei are indene, hydrindene, fluorene, and fluor-anthene.
From these nuclei an immense number of derivatives may
be obtained, for the hydrogen atoms may be substituted by any
of the radicals discussed in the preceding section on the classification
of organic compounds.</p>
</div>

<p>We now proceed to consider the properties, syntheses, decompositions
and constitution of the benzene complex. It has
already been stated that benzene derivatives may be
<span class="sidenote">Distinctions between aliphatic and aromatic compounds.</span>
regarded as formed by the replacement of hydrogen
atoms by other elements or radicals in exactly the
same manner as in the aliphatic series. Important
differences, however, are immediately met with
when we consider the methods by which derivatives
are obtained. For example: nitric acid and sulphuric
acid readily react with benzene and its homologues with the
production of nitro derivatives and sulphonic acids, while in the
aliphatic series these acids exert no substituting action (in the
case of the olefines, the latter acid forms an addition product);
another distinction is that the benzene complex is more stable
towards oxidizing agents. This and other facts connected with
the stability of benzenoid compounds are clearly shown when
we consider mixed aliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbons, <i>i.e.</i> compounds
derived by substituting aliphatic radicals in the benzene
nucleus; such a compound is methylbenzene or toluene,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>. This compound is readily oxidized to benzoic acid,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·COOH, the aromatic residue being unattacked; nitric
and sulphuric acids produce nitro-toluenes, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>·NO<span class="su">2</span>,
and toluene sulphonic acids, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>·SO<span class="su">3</span>H; chlorination
may result in the formation of derivatives substituted either
in the aromatic nucleus or in the side chain; the former substitution
occurs most readily, chlor-toluenes, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>·Cl, being
formed, while the latter, which needs an elevation in temperature
or other auxiliary, yields benzyl chloride, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>Cl, and
benzal chloride, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·CHCl<span class="su">2</span>. In general, the aliphatic residues
in such mixed compounds retain the characters of their class,
while the aromatic residues retain the properties of benzene.</p>

<p>Further differences become apparent when various typical
compounds are compared. The introduction of hydroxyl
groups into the benzene nucleus gives rise to compounds generically
named <i>phenols</i>, which, although resembling the aliphatic
alcohols in their origin, differ from these substances in their
increased chemical activity and acid nature. The phenols
more closely resemble the tertiary alcohols, since the hydroxyl
group is linked to a carbon atom which is united to other carbon
atoms by its remaining three valencies; hence on oxidation they
cannot yield the corresponding aldehydes, ketones or acids
(see below, <i>Decompositions of the Benzene Ring</i>). The amines
also exhibit striking differences: in the aliphatic series these
compounds may be directly formed from the alkyl haloids and
ammonia, but in the benzene series this reaction is quite impossible
unless the haloid atom be weakened by the presence of
other substituents, <i>e.g.</i> nitro groups. Moreover, while methylamine,
dimethylamine, and trimethylamine increase in basicity
corresponding to the introduction of successive methyl groups,
phenylamine or aniline, diphenylamine, and triphenylamine
are in decreasing order of basicity, the salts of diphenylamine
being decomposed by water. Mixed aromatic-aliphatic amines,
both secondary and tertiary, are also more strongly basic than
the pure aromatic amines, and less basic than the true aliphatic
compounds; <i>e.g.</i> aniline, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·NH<span class="su">2</span>, monomethyl aniline,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·NH·CH<span class="su">3</span>, and dimethyl aniline, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·N(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, are in
increasing order of basicity. These observations may be summarized
by saying that the benzene nucleus is more negative
in character than the aliphatic residues.</p>

<p><i>Isomerism of Benzene Derivatives.</i>&mdash;Although Kekulé founded
his famous benzene formula in 1865 on the assumptions that
the six hydrogen atoms in benzene are equivalent and that the
molecule is symmetrical, <i>i.e.</i> that two pairs of hydrogen atoms
are symmetrically situated with reference to any specified
hydrogen atom, the absolute demonstration of the validity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
these assumptions was first given by A. Ladenburg in 1874
(see <i>Ber.</i>, 1874, 7, p. 1684; 1875, 8, p. 1666; <i>Theorie der
aromatischen Verbindungen</i>, 1876). These results may be
graphically represented as follows: numbering the hydrogen
atoms in cyclical order from 1 to 6, then the first thesis demands
that whichever atom is substituted the same compound results,
while the second thesis points out that the pairs 2 and 6, and 3
and 5 are symmetrical with respect to 1, or in other words, the
di-substitution derivatives 1.2 and 1.6, and also 1.3 and 1.5 are
identical. Therefore three di-derivatives are possible, viz.
1.2 or 1.6, named <i>ortho</i>- (o), 1.3 or 1.5, named <i>meta</i>- (m), and
1.4, named <i>para</i>- compounds (p). In the same way it may be
shown that three tri-substitution, three tetra-substitution, one
penta-substitution, and one hexa-substitution derivative are
possible. Of the tri-substitution derivatives, 1.2.3.-compounds
are known as &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; or &ldquo;vicinal&rdquo; (v), the 1.2.4 as &ldquo;asymmetrical&rdquo;
(as), the 1.3.5 as &ldquo;symmetrical&rdquo; (s); of the tetra-substitution
derivatives, 1.2.3.4-compounds are known as
&ldquo;adjacent,&rdquo; 1.2.3.5 as &ldquo;asymmetrical,&rdquo; and 1.2.4.5 as &ldquo;symmetrical.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:107px" src="images/img53a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we have assumed the substituent groups to be alike;
when they are unlike, a greater number of isomers is possible.
Thus in the tri-substitution derivatives six isomers, and no
more, are possible when two of the substituents are alike; for
instance, six diaminobenzoic acids, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>(NH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">2</span>COOH, are
known; when all are unlike ten isomers are possible; thus,
ten oxytoluic acids, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>·OH·COOH, are known. In the
case of tetra-substituted compounds, thirty isomers are possible
when all the groups are different.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The preceding considerations render it comparatively easy to
follow the reasoning on which the experimental verification of the
above statements is based. The proof is divided into two
<span class="sidenote">Equivalence of four hydrogen atoms.</span>
parts: (1) that four hydrogen atoms are equal, and
(2) that two pairs of hydrogen atoms are symmetrical with
reference to a specified hydrogen atom. In the first thesis,
phenol or oxybenzene, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·OH, in which we will assume the
hydroxyl group to occupy position 1, is converted into brombenzene,
which is then converted into benzoic acid, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·COOH. From this
substance, an oxybenzoic acid (<i>meta</i>-), C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>·OH·COOH, may be
prepared; and the two other known oxybenzoic acids (<i>ortho</i>- and
<i>para</i>-) may be converted into benzoic acid. These three acids yield
on heating phenol, identical with the substance started with, and
since in the three oxybenzoic acids the hydroxyl groups must occupy
positions other than 1, it follows that <i>four</i> hydrogen atoms are equal
in value.</p>

<p>R. Hübner and A. Petermann (<i>Ann.</i>, 1869, 149, p. 129) provided
the proof of the equivalence of the atoms 2 and 6 with respect
to 1.  From meta-brombenzoic acid two nitrobrombenzoic
<span class="sidenote">Symmetry of pairs of hydrogen atoms.</span>
acids are obtained on direct nitration; elimination of the
bromine atom and the reduction of the nitro to an amino
group in these two acids results in the formation of the same
ortho-aminobenzoic acid. Hence the positions occupied by
the nitro groups in the two different nitrobrombenzoic acids must be
symmetrical with respect to the carboxyl group. In 1879, Hübner
(<i>Ann.</i>, 195, p. 4) proved the equivalence of the second pair, viz.
3 and 5, by starting out with ortho-aminobenzoic acid, previously
obtained by two different methods. This substance readily yields
ortho-oxybenzoic acid or salicylic acid, which on nitration yields two
mononitro-oxybenzoic acids. By eliminating the hydroxy groups
in these acids the same nitrobenzoic acid is obtained, which yields
on reduction an aminobenzoic acid different from the starting-out
acid. Therefore there must be another pair of hydrogen atoms,
other than 2 and 6, which are symmetrical with respect to 1. The
symmetry of the second pair was also established in 1878 by E.
Wroblewsky (<i>Ann.</i>, 192, p. 196).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Orientation of Substituent Groups.</i>&mdash;The determination of the
relative positions of the substituents in a benzene derivative
constitutes an important factor in the general investigation
of such compounds. Confining our attention, for the present, to
di-substitution products we see that there are three distinct
series of compounds to be considered. Generally if any group
be replaced by another group, then the second group enters the
nucleus in the position occupied by the displaced group; this
means that if we can definitely orientate three di-derivatives
of benzene, then any other compound, which can be obtained
from or converted into one of our typical derivatives, may be
definitely orientated. Intermolecular transformations&mdash;migrations
of substituent groups from one carbon atom to another&mdash;are
of fairly common occurrence among oxy compounds at
elevated temperatures. Thus potassium ortho-oxybenzoate is
converted into the salt of para-oxybenzoic acid at 220°; the
three bromphenols, and also the brombenzenesulphonic acids,
yield m-dioxybenzene or resorcin when fused with potash. It is
necessary, therefore, to avoid reactions involving such
intermolecular migrations when determining the orientation of
aromatic compounds.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Such a series of typical compounds are the benzene dicarboxylic acids
(phthalic acids), C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>(COOH)<span class="su">2</span>. C. Graebe (<i>Ann.</i>, 1869, 149,
p. 22) orientated the ortho-compound or phthalic acid from its
formation from naphthalene on oxidation; the meta-compound or
isophthalic acid is orientated by its production from mesitylene,
shown by A. Ladenburg (<i>Ann.</i>, 1875, 179, p. 163) to be symmetrical
trimethyl benzene; terephthalic acid, the remaining isomer, must
therefore be the para-compound.</p>

<p>P. Griess (<i>Ber.</i>, 1872, 5, p. 192; 1874, 7, p. 1223) orientated the
three diaminobenzenes or phenylene diamines by considering their
preparation by the elimination of the carboxyl group in the six
diaminobenzoic acids. The diaminobenzene resulting from two of
these acids is the ortho-compound; from three, the meta-; and
from one the para-; this is explained by the following scheme:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:153px" src="images/img53b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>W. Körner (<i>Gazz. Chem. Ital.</i>, 4, p. 305) in 1874 orientated the
three dibrombenzenes in a somewhat similar manner. Starting with
the three isomeric compounds, he found that one gave two
tribrombenzenes, another gave three, while the third gave only one. A
scheme such as the preceding one shows that the first dibrombenzene
must be the ortho-compound, the second the meta-, and the third
the para-derivative. Further research in this direction was made by
D.E. Noetling (<i>Ber.</i>, 1885, 18, p. 2657), who investigated the nitro-,
amino-, and oxy-xylenes in their relations to the three xylenes or
dimethyl benzenes.</p>

<p>The orientation of higher substitution derivatives is determined
by considering the di- and tri-substitution compounds into which
they can be transformed.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Substitution of the Benzene Ring.</i>&mdash;As a general rule, homologues
and mono-derivatives of benzene react more readily with
substituting agents than the parent hydrocarbon; for example,
phenol is converted into tribromphenol by the action of bromine
water, and into the nitrophenols by dilute nitric acid; similar
activity characterizes aniline. Not only does the substituent
group modify the readiness with which the derivative is attacked,
but also the nature of the product. Starting with a
mono-derivative, we have seen that a substituent group may enter
in either of three positions to form an ortho-, meta-, or
para-compound. Experience has shown that such mono-derivatives
as nitro compounds, sulphonic acids, carboxylic acids, aldehydes,
and ketones yield as a general rule chiefly the meta-compounds,
and this is independent of the nature of the second group
introduced; on the other hand, benzene haloids, amino-,
homologous-, and hydroxy-benzenes yield principally a mixture
of the ortho- and para-compounds. These facts are embodied
in the &ldquo;Rule of Crum Brown and J. Gibson&rdquo; (<i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>
61, p. 367): If the hydrogen compound of the substituent
already in the benzene nucleus can be directly oxidized to the
corresponding hydroxyl compound, then meta-derivatives
predominate on further substitution, if not, then ortho- and
para-derivatives. By further substitution of ortho- and
para-di-derivatives, in general the same tri-derivative [1.2.4] is formed
(<i>Ann.</i>, 1878, 192, p. 219); meta-compounds yield [1.3.4] and
[1.2.3] tri-derivatives, except in such cases as when both
substituent groups are strongly acid, <i>e.g.</i> m-dinitrobenzene, then
[1.3.5]-derivatives are obtained.</p>

<p><i>Syntheses of the Benzene Ring.</i>&mdash;The characteristic distinctions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
which exist between aliphatic and benzenoid compounds make
the transformations of one class into the other especially
interesting.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the first place we may notice a tendency of several aliphatic
compounds, <i>e.g.</i> methane, tetrachlormethane, &amp;c., to yield aromatic
compounds when subjected to a high temperature, the so-called
pyrogenetic reactions (from Greek <span class="grk" title="pyr">&#960;&#8166;&#961;</span>, fire, and <span class="grk" title="gennaô">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#969;</span>, I produce);
the predominance of benzenoid, and related compounds&mdash;naphthalene,
anthracene, phenanthrene, &amp;c.&mdash;in coal-tar is probably to be
associated with similar pyrocondensations. Long-continued treatment
with halogens may, in some cases, result in the formation of
aromatic compounds; thus perchlorbenzene, C<span class="su">6</span>Cl<span class="su">6</span>, frequently
appears as a product of exhaustive chlorination, while hexyl iodide,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">13</span>I, yields perchlor- and perbrom-benzene quite readily.</p>

<p>The trimolecular polymerization of numerous acetylene compounds&mdash;substances
containing two trebly linked carbon atoms, &mdash;C:C&mdash;,
to form derivatives of benzene is of considerable interest.
M.P.E. Berthelot first accomplished the synthesis of benzene in
1870 by leading acetylene, HC÷CH, through tubes heated to dull
redness; at higher temperatures the action becomes reversible,
the benzene yielding diphenyl, diphenylbenzene, and acetylene.
The condensation of acetylene to benzene is also possible at ordinary
temperatures by leading the gas over pyrophoric iron, nickel,
cobalt, or spongy platinum (P. Sabatier and J.B. Senderens).
The homologues of acetylene condense more readily; thus allylene,
CH÷C·CH<span class="su">3</span>, and crotonylene, CH<span class="su">3</span>·C&#8758;C·CH<span class="su">3</span>, yield trimethyl- and
hexamethyl-benzene under the influence of sulphuric acid. Toluene
or mono-methylbenzene results from the pyrocondensation of a
mixture of acetylene and allylene. Substituted acetylenes also
exhibit this form of condensation; for instance, bromacetylene,
BrC&#8758;CH, is readily converted into tribrombenzene, while propiolic
acid, HC&#8758;C·COOH, under the influence of sunlight, gives benzene
tricarboxylic acid.</p>

<p>A larger and more important series of condensations may be
grouped together as resulting from the elimination of the elements
of water between carbonyl (CO) and methylene (CH<span class="su">2</span>) groups.
A historic example is that of the condensation of three molecules of
acetone, CH<span class="su">3</span>·CO·CH<span class="su">3</span>, in the presence of sulphuric acid, to s-trimethylbenzene
or mesitylene, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">3</span>, first observed in 1837 by
R. Kane; methylethyl ketone and methyl-n-propyl ketone suffer
similar condensations to s-triethylbenzene and s-tri-n-propylbenzene
respectively. Somewhat similar condensations are: of geranial or
citral, (CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>CH·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH:CH·C(CH<span class="su">3</span>):CH·CHO, to p-isopropyl-methylbenzene
or cymene; of the condensation product of methylethylacrolein
and acetone, CH<span class="su">3</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH:C(CH<span class="su">3</span>)·CH:CH·CO·CH<span class="su">3</span>,
to [1.3.4]-trimethylbenzene or pseudocumene; and of the condensation
product of two molecules of isovaleryl aldehyde with one
of acetone, C<span class="su">3</span>H<span class="su">7</span>·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH:C(C<span class="su">3</span>H<span class="su">7</span>)·CH:CH·CO·CH<span class="su">3</span>, to (1)-methyl-2-4-di-isopropyl
benzene. An analogous synthesis is that of di-hydro-m-xylene
from methyl heptenone, (CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>C:CH·(CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">2</span>·CO·CH<span class="su">3</span>.
Certain a-diketones condense to form benzenoid quinones, two
molecules of the diketone taking part in the reaction; thus diacetyl,
CH<span class="su">3</span>·CO·CO·CH<span class="su">3</span>, yields p-xyloquinone, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">2</span>(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">2</span> (<i>Ber.</i>, 1888,
21, p. 1411), and acetylpropionyl, CH<span class="su">3</span>·CO·CO·C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, yields duroquinone,
or tetramethylquinone, C<span class="su">6</span>(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">2</span>. Oxymethylene compounds,
characterized by the grouping >C:CH(OH), also give
benzene derivatives by hydrolytic condensation between three
molecules; thus oxymethylene acetone, or formyl acetone,
CH<span class="su">3</span>·CO·CH:CH(OH), formed by acting on formic ester with acetone
in the presence of sodium ethylate, readily yields [1.3.5]-triacetylbenzene,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>(CO·CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">3</span>; oxymethylene acetic ester or formyl
acetic ester or &beta;-oxyacrylic ester, (HO)CH:CH·CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, formed by
condensing acetic ester with formic ester, and also its dimolecular
condensation product, coumalic acid, readily yields esters of [1.3.5]-benzene
tricarboxylic acid or trimesic acid (see <i>Ber.</i>, 1887, 20,
p. 2930).</p>

<p>In 1890, O. Doebner (<i>Ber.</i> 23, p. 2377) investigated the condensation
of pyroracemic acid, CH<span class="su">3</span>·CO·COOH, with various aliphatic aldehydes,
and obtained from two molecules of the acid and one of the
aldehyde in the presence of baryta water alkylic isophthalic acids:
with acetaldehyde [1.3.5]-methylisophthalic acid or uvitic acid,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>·(COOH)<span class="su">2</span>, was obtained, with propionic aldehyde [1.3.5]-ethylisophthalic
acid, and with butyric aldehyde the corresponding
propylisophthalic acid. We may here mention the synthesis of
oxyuvitic ester (5-methyl-4-oxy-1-3-benzene dicarboxylic ester) by
the condensation of two molecules of sodium acetoacetic ester
with one of chloroform (<i>Ann.</i>, 1883, 222, p. 249). Of other
syntheses of true benzene derivatives, mention may be made of
the formation of orcinol or [3.5]-dioxytoluene from dehydracetic
acid; and the formation of esters of oxytoluic acid (5-methyl-3-oxy-benzoic
acid), C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>·CH<span class="su">3</span>·OH·COOH, when acetoneoxalic ester,
CH<span class="su">3</span>·CO·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CO·CO·CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, is boiled with baryta (<i>Ber.</i>, 1889,
22, p. 3271). Of interest also are H.B. Hill and J. Torray&rsquo;s observations
on nitromalonic aldehyde, NO<span class="su">2</span>·CH(CHO)<span class="su">2</span>, formed by acting on
mucobromic acid, probably CHO·CBr:CBr:COOH, with alkaline
nitrites; this substance condenses with acetone to give p-nitrophenol,
and forms [1.3.5]-trinitrobenzene when its sodium salt is decomposed
with an acid.</p>

<p>By passing carbon monoxide over heated potassium J. von Liebig
discovered, in 1834, an interesting aromatic compound, potassium
carbon monoxide or potassium hexaoxybenzene, the nature of
which was satisfactorily cleared up by R. Nietzki and T. Benckiser
(<i>Ber</i>. 18, p. 499) in 1885, who showed that it yielded hexaoxybenzene,
C<span class="su">6</span>(OH)<span class="su">6</span>, when acted upon with dilute hydrochloric acid;
further investigation of this compound brought to light a considerable
number of highly interesting derivatives (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Quinones</a></span>).
Another hexa-substituted benzene compound capable of direct
synthesis is mellitic acid or benzene carboxylic acid, C<span class="su">6</span>(COOH)<span class="su">6</span>.
This substance, first obtained from the mineral honeystone, aluminium
mellitate, by M.H. Klaproth in 1799, is obtained when pure
carbon (graphite or charcoal) is oxidized by alkaline permanganate,
or when carbon forms the positive pole in an electrolytic cell (<i>Ber.</i>,
1883, 16, p. 1209). The composition of this substance was determined
by A. von Baeyer in 1870, who obtained benzene on distilling
the calcium salt with lime.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have generally restricted ourselves to syntheses
which result in the production of a true benzene ring; but there
are many reactions by which reduced benzene rings are synthesized,
and from the compounds so obtained true benzenoid compounds
may be prepared. Of such syntheses we may notice: the condensation
of sodium malonic ester to phloroglucin tricarboxylic
ester, a substance which gives phloroglucin or trioxybenzene when
fused with alkalis, and behaves both as a triketohexamethylene
tricarboxylic ester and as a trioxybenzene tricarboxylic ester; the
condensation of succinic ester, (CH<span class="su">2</span>·CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, under the influence
of sodium to succinosuccinic ester, a diketohexamethylene dicarboxylic
ester, which readily yields dioxyterephthalic acid and
hydroquinpne (F. Herrmann, <i>Ann.</i>, 1882, 211, p. 306; also see below,
<i>Configuration of the Benzene Complex</i>); the condensation of acetone
dicarboxylic ester with malonic ester to form triketohexamethylene
dicarboxylic ester (E. Rimini, <i>Gazz. Chem.</i>, 1896, 26, (2), p. 374);
the condensation of acetone-di-propionic acid under the influence
of boiling water to a diketohexamethylene propionic acid (von
Pechmann and Sidgwick, <i>Ber.</i>, 1904, 37, p. 3816). Many diketo
compounds suffer condensation between two molecules to form
hydrobenzene derivatives, thus &alpha;, &gamma;-di-acetoglutaric ester,
C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>O<span class="su">2</span>C(CH<span class="su">3</span>·CO)CH·CH<span class="su">2</span>·CH(CO·CH<span class="su">3</span>)CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, yields a methyl-ketohexamethylene,
while &gamma;-acetobutyric ester, CH<span class="su">3</span>CO(CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">2</span>CO<span class="su">2</span>C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>,
is converted into dihydroresorcinol or m-diketohexamethylene by
sodium ethylate; this last reaction is reversed by baryta (see <i>Decompositions
of Benzene Ring</i>). For other syntheses of hexamethylene
derivatives, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polymethylenes</a></span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Decompositions of the Benzene Ring.</i>&mdash;We have previously
alluded to the relative stability of the benzene complex; consequently
reactions which lead to its disruption are all the more
interesting, and have engaged the attention of many chemists.
If we accept Kekulé&rsquo;s formula for the benzene nucleus, then we
may expect the double linkages to be opened up partially, either
by oxidation or reduction, with the formation of di-, tetra-, or
hexa-hydro derivatives, or entirely, with the production of open
chain compounds. Generally rupture occurs at more than one
point; and rarely are the six carbon atoms of the complex
regained as an open chain. Certain compounds withstand ring
decomposition much more strongly than others; for instance,
benzene and its homologues, carboxylic acids, and nitro compounds
are much more stable towards oxidizing agents than
amino- and oxy-benzenes, aminophenols, quinones, and oxy-carboxylic
acids.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Strong oxidation breaks the benzene complex into such compounds
as carbon dioxide, oxalic acid, formic acid, &amp;c.; such decompositions
are of little interest. More important are Kekulé&rsquo;s

oxidizing powers. L. Carius showed that potassium

chlorate and sulphuric acid oxidized benzene to trichlor-phenomalic
acid, a substance afterwards investigated by
Kekulé and O. Strecker (<i>Ann.</i>, 1884, 223, p. 170), and
shown to be &beta;-trichloracetoacrylic acid, CCl<span class="su">3</span>·CO·CH:CH·COOH,
which with baryta gave chloroform and maleic acid. Potassium
chlorate and hydrochloric acid oxidize phenol, salicylic acid (o-oxybenzoic
acid), and gallic acid ([2.3.4] trioxybenzoic acid) to trichlorpyroracemic
acid (isotrichlorglyceric acid), CCl<span class="su">3</span>·C(OH)<span class="su">2</span>·CO<span class="su">2</span>H,
a substance also obtained from trichloracetonitrile, CCl<span class="su">3</span>·CO·CN, by

([2.4.6]-trinitrophenol) into chloropicrin, CCl<span class="su">3</span>NO<span class="su">2</span>, by bleaching lime
(calcium hypochlorite), and into bromopicrin, CBr<span class="su">3</span>NO<span class="su">2</span>, by bromine

The action of chlorine upon di-and tri-oxybenzenes has been
carefully investigated by Th. Zincke; and his researches have led
to the discovery of many chlorinated oxidation products which admit
of decomposition into cyclic compounds containing fewer carbon
atoms than characterize the benzene ring, and in turn yielding
open-chain or aliphatic compounds. In general, the rupture occurs
between a-keto group (CO) and a keto-chloride group (CCl<span class="su">2</span>), into
which two adjacent carbon atoms of the ring are converted by the
oxidizing and substituting action of chlorine. Decompositions of
this nature were first discovered in the naphthalene series, where it
was found that derivatives of indene (and of hydrindene and indone)
and also of benzene resulted; Zincke then extended his methods to
the disintegration of the oxybenzenes and obtained analogous
results, R-pentene and aliphatic derivatives being formed
(R- symbolizing a ringed nucleus).</p>

<p>When treated with chlorine, pyrocatechol (1.2 or ortho-dioxybenzene)
(1) yields a tetrachlor ortho-quinone, which suffers further
chlorination to hexachlor-o-diketo-R-hexene (2). This substance is
transformed into hexachlor-R-pentene oxycarboxylic acid (3) when
digested with water; and chromic acid oxidizes this substance to
hexachlor-R-pentene (4). The ring of this compound is ruptured by
caustic soda with the formation of perchlorvinyl acrylic acid (5),
which gives on reduction ethidine propionic acid (6), a compound
containing five of the carbon atoms originally in the benzene ring
(see Zincke, <i>Ber.</i>, 1894, 27, p. 3364) (the carbon atoms are
omitted in some of the formulae).</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:87px" src="images/img55a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Resorcin (1.3 or meta dioxybenzene) (1) is decomposed in a
somewhat similar manner. Chlorination in glacial acetic acid
solution yields pentachlor-m-diketo-R-hexene (2) and, at a later
stage, heptachlor-m-diketo-R-hexene (3). These compounds are
both decomposed by water, the former giving dichloraceto-trichlor-crotonic
acid (4), which on boiling with water gives dichlormethyl-vinyl-a-diketone
(5). The heptachlor compound when treated with
chlorine water gives trichloraceto-pentachlorbutyric acid (6), which
is hydrolysed by alkalis to chloroform and pentachlorglutaric acid
(7), and is converted by boiling water into tetrachlor-diketo-R-pentene
(8). This latter compound may be chlorinated to
perchloracetoacrylic chloride (9), from which the corresponding acid
(10) is obtained by treatment with water; alkalis hydrolyse the acid
to chloroform and dichlormaleic acid (11).</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:450px; height:267px" src="images/img55b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hydroquinone (1.4 or para-dioxybenzene) (1) gives with chlorine,
first, a tetrachlorquinone (2), and then hexachlor-p-diketo-R-hexene
(3), which alcoholic potash converts into perchloracroylacrylic acid
(4). This substance, and also the preceding compound, is converted
by aqueous caustic soda into dichlormaleic acid, trichlorethylene,
and hydrochloric acid (5) (Th. Zincke and O. Fuchs, <i>Ann.</i>, 1892,
267, p. 1).</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:450px; height:86px" src="images/img55c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Phloroglucin (1.3.5-trioxybenzene) (1) behaves similarly to
resorcin, hexachlor [1.3.5] triketo-R-hexylene (2) being first formed.
This compound is converted by chlorine water into octachloracetylacetone
(3); by methyl alcohol into the ester of dichlormalonic acid
and tetrachloracetone (4); whilst ammonia gives dichloracetamide
(5) (Th. Zincke and O. Kegel, <i>Ber.</i>, 1890, 23, p. 1706).</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:450px; height:85px" src="images/img55d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When phenol is oxidized in acid solution by chlorine, tetrachlorquinone

A. Hantzsch (<i>Ber.</i>, 1889, 22, p. 1238) succeeded in obtaining
derivatives of o-diketo-R-hexene, which yield
R-pentene and aliphatic compounds on decomposition.
When thus chlorinated phenol (1) yields trichlor-o-diketo-R-hexene
(2), which may be hydrolysed to an acid (3), which, in turn,
suffers rearrangement to trichlor-R-pentene-oxycarboxylic acid (4).
Bromine water oxidizes this substance to oxalic acid and tetrabrom-dichloracetone
(5).</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:450px; height:77px" src="images/img55e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reduction of o-oxybenzoic acids by sodium in amyl alcohol
solution has been studied by A. Einhorn and J.S. Lumsden (<i>Ann.</i>,
1895, 286, p. 257). It is probable that tetrahydro acids are first
formed, which suffer rearrangement to orthoketone carboxylic acids.
These substances absorb water and become pimelic acids. Thus
salicylic acid yields n-pimelic acid, HOOC·(CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">5</span>·COOH, while o-,
m-, and p-cresotinic acids, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>(CH<span class="su">3</span>)(OH)(COOH), yield isomeric
methylpimelic acids.</p>

<p>Resorcin on reduction gives dihydroresorcin, which G. Merling
(<i>Ann.</i>, 1894, 278, p. 20) showed to be converted into n-glutaric acid,
HOOC·(CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">3</span>·COOH, when oxidized with potassium permanganate;
according to D. Vörlander (<i>Ber.</i>, 1895, 28, p. 2348) it is converted
into &gamma;-acetobutyric acid, CH<span class="su">3</span>CO·(CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">3</span>·COOH, when heated with
baryta to 150-160°.</p>

<p><i>Configuration of the Benzene Complex.</i>&mdash;The development of
the &ldquo;structure theory&rdquo; in about 1860 brought in its train an
appreciation of the chemical structure of the derivatives of
benzene. The pioneer in this field was August Kekulé, who,
in 1865 (<i>Ann.</i>, 137, p. 129; see also his <i>Lehrbuch der organischen
Chemie</i>), submitted his well-known formula for benzene, so
founding the &ldquo;benzene theory&rdquo; and opening up a problem
which, notwithstanding the immense amount of labour since
bestowed upon it, still remains imperfectly solved. Arguing
from the existence of only one mono-substitution derivative,
and of three di-derivatives (statements of which the rigorous
proof was then wanting), he was led to arrange the six carbon
atoms in a ring, attaching a hydrogen atom to each carbon
atom; being left with the fourth carbon valencies, he mutually
saturated these in pairs, thus obtaining the symbol I (see below).
The value of this ringed structure was readily perceived, but
objections were raised with respect to Kekulé&rsquo;s disposal of the
fourth valencies. In 1866 Sir James Dewar proposed an unsymmetrical
form (II); while in 1867, A. Claus (<i>Theoretische
Betrachtungen und deren Anwendung zur Systematik der organischen
Chemie</i>) proposed his diagonal formula (III), and two years
later, A. Ladenburg (<i>Ber.</i>, 2, p. 140) devised his prism formula
(IV), the six carbon atoms being placed at the six corners of a
right equilateral triangular prism, with its plane projections
(V, VI).</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:107px" src="images/img55f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One of the earliest and strongest objections urged against Kekulé&rsquo;s
formula was that it demanded two isomeric ortho-di-substitution
derivatives; for if we number the carbon atoms in cyclical
<span class="sidenote">Objections to Kekulé&rsquo;s formula.</span>
order from 1 to 6, then the derivatives 1·2 and 1·6 should
be different.<a name="FnAnchor_13b" id="FnAnchor_13b" href="#Footnote_13b"><span class="sp">13</span></a> Ladenburg submitted that if the 1·2 and
1·6 compounds were identical, then we should expect the
two well-known crotonic acids, CH<span class="su">3</span>·CH:CH·COOH and
CH<span class="su">2</span>:CH·CH<span class="su">2</span>·COOH, to be identical. This view was opposed by
Victor Meyer and Kekulé. The former pointed out that the supposed
isomerism was not due to an arrangement of atoms, but to the disposition
of a valency, and therefore it was doubtful whether such a
subtle condition could exert any influence on the properties of the
substance. Kekulé answered Ladenburg by formulating a dynamic
interpretation of valency. He assumed that if we have one atom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
connected by single bonds to (say) four other atoms, then in a certain
unit of time it will collide with each of these atoms in turn. Now
suppose two of the attached atoms are replaced by one atom, then
this atom must have two valencies directed to the central atom;
and consequently, in the same unit of time, the central atom will
collide once with each of the two monovalent atoms and twice with
the divalent. Applying this notion to benzene, let us consider the
impacts made by the carbon atom (1) which we will assume to be
doubly linked to the carbon atom (2) and singly linked to (6), h
standing for the hydrogen atom. In the first unit of time, the
impacts are 2, 6, h, 2; and in the second 6, 2, h, 6. If we represent
graphically the impacts in the second unit of time, we perceive that
they point to a configuration in which the double linkage is between
the carbon atoms 1 and 6, and the single linkage between 1 and 2.
Therefore, according to Kekulé, the double linkages are in a state of
continual oscillation, and if his dynamical notion of valency, or a
similar hypothesis, be correct, then the difference between the 1.2
and 1.6 di-derivatives rests on the insufficiency of his formula,
which represents the configuration during one set of oscillations only.
The difference is only apparent, not real. An analogous oscillation
prevails in the pyrazol nucleus, for L. Knorr (<i>Ann.</i>, 1894, 279, p. 188)
has shown that 3- and 5-methylpyrazols are identical.</p>

<p>The explanation thus attempted by Kekulé was adversely criticized,
more especially by A. Ladenburg, who devoted much attention
to the study of the substitution products of benzene, and
<span class="sidenote">Ladenburg&rsquo;s formula.</span>
to the support of his own formula. His views are presented
in his Pamphlet: <i>Theorie der aromatischen Verbindungen</i>,
1876. The prism formula also received support from the
following data: protocatechuic acid when oxidized by nitrous acid
gives carboxytartronic acid, which, on account of its ready
decomposition into carbon dioxide and tartronic acid, was considered
to be HO·C(COOH)<span class="su">3</span>. This implied that in the benzene complex
there was at least one carbon atom linked to three others, thus
rendering Kekulé&rsquo;s formula impossible and Ladenburg&rsquo;s and Claus&rsquo;
possible. Kekulé (<i>Ann.</i>, 1883, 221, p. 230), however, reinvestigated
this acid; he showed that it was dibasic and not tribasic; that it
gave tartaric acid on reduction; and, finally, that it was
dioxytartaric acid, HOOC·C(OH)<span class="su">2</span>·C(OH)<span class="su">2</span>·COOH. The formation of
this substance readily follows from Kekulé&rsquo;s formula, while considerable
difficulties are met with when one attempts an explanation
based on Ladenburg&rsquo;s representation. Kekulé also urged that the
formation of trichlorphenomalic acid, shown by him and O. Strecker
to be trichloracetoacrylic acid, was more favourably explained by
his formula than by Ladenburg&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Other objections to Ladenburg&rsquo;s formula resulted from A. von
Baeyer&rsquo;s researches (commenced in 1886) on the reduced phthalic
acids. Baeyer pointed out that although benzene derivatives
<span class="sidenote">Baeyer&rsquo;s researches.</span>
were obtainable from hexamethylene compounds,
yet it by no means follows that only hexamethylene
compounds need result when benzene compounds are reduced. He
admitted the possibility of the formulae of Kekulé, Claus, Dewar
and Ladenburg, although as to the last di-trimethylene derivatives
should be possible reduction products, being formed by severing
two of the prism edges; and he attempted to solve the problem by a
systematic investigation of the reduced phthalic acids.</p>

<p>Ladenburg&rsquo;s prism admits of one mono-substitution derivative
and three di-derivatives. Furthermore, it is in accordance with
certain simple syntheses of benzene derivatives (<i>e.g.</i> from acetylene
and acetone); but according to Baeyer (<i>Ber.</i>, 1886, 19, p. 1797)
it fails to explain the formation of dioxyterephthalic ester from
succinosuccinic ester, unless we make the assumption that the
transformation of these substances is attended by a migration of the
substituent groups. For succinosuccinic ester, formed by the action
of sodium on two molecules of succinic ester, has either of the formulae
(I) or (II); oxidation of the free acid gives dioxyterephthalic acid in
which the para-positions must remain substituted as in (I) and (II).
By projecting Ladenburg&rsquo;s prism on a plane and numbering the
atoms so as to correspond with Kekulé&rsquo;s form, viz. that 1.2 and 1.6
should be ortho-positions, 1.3 and 1.5 meta-, and 1.4 para-, and
following out the transformation on the Ladenburg formula, then
an ortho-dioxyterephthalic acid (IV) should result, a fact denied
by experience, and inexplicable unless we assume a wandering of
atoms. Kekulé&rsquo;s formula (III), on the other hand, is in full agreement
(Baeyer). This explanation has been challenged by Ladenburg</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:86px" src="images/img56a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">(<i>Ber.</i>, 1886, 19, p. 971; <i>Ber.</i>, 1887, 20, p. 62) and by A.K. Miller
(<i>J.C.S. Trans.</i>, 1887, p. 208). The transformation is not one of the
oxidation of a hexamethylene compound to a benzenoid compound,
for only two hydrogen atoms are removed. Succinosuccinic ester
behaves both as a ketone and as a phenol, thereby exhibiting
desmotropy; assuming the ketone formula as indicating the
constitution, then in Baeyer&rsquo;s equation we have a migration of a
hydrogen atom, whereas to bring Ladenburg&rsquo;s formula into line,
an oxygen atom must migrate.</p>

<p>The relative merits of the formulae of Kekulé, Claus and Dewar
were next investigated by means of the reduction products of benzene,
it being Baeyer&rsquo;s intention to detect whether double linkages were
or were not present in the benzene complex.</p>

<p>To follow Baeyer&rsquo;s results we must explain his nomenclature of
the reduced benzene derivatives. He numbers the carbon atoms
placed at the corners of a hexagon from 1 to 6, and each side in the
same order, so that the carbon atoms 1 and 2 are connected by the
side 1, atoms 2 and 3 by the side 2, and so on. A doubly linked pair
of atoms is denoted by the sign &Delta; with the index corresponding to
the side; if there are two pairs of double links, then indices corresponding
to both sides are employed. Thus &Delta;<span class="sp">1</span> denotes a tetrahydro
derivative in which the double link occupies the side 1; &Delta;<span class="sp">1.3</span>, a
dihydro derivative, the double links being along the sides 1 and 3.
Another form of isomerism is occasioned by spatial arrangements,
many of the <i>reduced</i> terephthalic acids existing in two stereo-isomeric
forms. Baeyer explains this by analogy with fumaric and maleic
acids: he assumes the reduced benzene ring to lie in a plane; when
both carboxyl groups are on the same side of this plane, the acids, in
general, resemble maleic acids, these forms he denotes by &Gamma;<i>cis-cis</i>,
or shortly <i>cis</i>-; when the carboxyl groups are on opposite sides,
the acids correspond to fumaric acid, these forms are denoted by
&Gamma;<i>cis-trans</i>, or shortly <i>trans</i>-.</p>

<p>By reducing terephthalic acid with sodium amalgam, care being
taken to neutralize the caustic soda simultaneously formed by
passing in carbon dioxide, &Delta;<span class="sp">2.5</span> dihydroterephthalic acid is obtained;
this results from the splitting of a <i>para</i>-linkage. By boiling with water
the &Delta;<span class="sp">2.5</span> acid is converted into the &Delta;<span class="sp">1.5</span> dihydroterephthalic
acid. This acid is converted into the &Delta;<span class="sp">1.4</span> acid by soda, and into the
&Delta;<span class="sp">2</span> tetrahydro acid by reduction. From this acid the &Delta;<span class="sp">1.3</span>
dihydro and the &Delta;<span class="sp">1</span> tetrahydro acids may be obtained, from both of which
the hexahydro acid may be prepared. From these results Baeyer
concluded that Claus&rsquo; formula with three para-linkings cannot
possibly be correct, for the &Delta;<span class="sp">2.5</span> dihydroterephthalic acid undoubtedly
has two ethylene linkages, since it readily takes up two or four
atoms of bromine, and is oxidized in warm aqueous solution by
alkaline potassium permanganate. But the formation of the &Delta;<span class="sp">2.5</span>
acid as the first reduction product is not fully consistent with Kekulé&rsquo;s
symbol, for we should then expect the &Delta;<span class="sp">1.3</span> or the &Delta;<span class="sp">1.5</span> acid
to be first formed (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polymethylenes</a></span>).</p>
</div>

<p>The stronger argument against the ethylenoid linkages
demanded by Kekulé&rsquo;s formula is provided by the remarkable
stability towards oxidizing and reducing agents which
characterizes all benzenoid compounds. From the fact that
reduction products containing either one or two double linkages
behave exactly as unsaturated aliphatic compounds, being
readily reduced or oxidized, and combining with the halogen
elements and haloid acids, it seems probable that in benzenoid
compounds the fourth valencies are symmetrically distributed
in such a manner as to induce a peculiar stability in the molecule.
Such a configuration was proposed in 1887 by H.E. Armstrong
(<i>J.C.S. Trans.</i>, 1887, p. 258), and shortly afterwards by Baeyer
(<i>Ann.</i>, 1888, 245, p. 103). In this formula, the so-called &ldquo;centric
formula,&rdquo; the assumption made is that the fourth valencies are
simply <i>directed</i> towards the centre of the ring; nothing further
is said about the fourth valencies except that they exert a
pressure towards the centre. Claus maintained that Baeyer&rsquo;s
view was identical with his own, for as in Baeyer&rsquo;s formula, the
fourth valencies have a different function from the peripheral
valencies, being united at the centre in a form of potential union.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine which configuration most accurately
explains the observed facts; Kekulé&rsquo;s formula undoubtedly
explains the synthetical production of benzenoid compounds
most satisfactorily, and W. Marckwald (<i>Ann.</i>, 1893, 274, p. 331;
1894, 279, p. 14) has supported this formula from considerations
based on the syntheses of the quinoline ring. Further researches
by Baeyer, and upon various nitrogenous ring systems by E.
Bamberger (a strong supporter of the centric formula), have
shown that the nature of the substituent groups influences the
distribution of the fourth valencies; therefore it may be concluded
that in compounds the benzene nucleus appears to be
capable of existence in two tautomeric forms, in the sense that
each particular derivative possesses a definite constitution.
The benzene nucleus presents a remarkable case, which must be
considered in the formulation of any complete theory of valency.
From a study of the reduction of compounds containing two
ethylenic bonds united by a single bond, termed a &ldquo;conjugated
system,&rdquo; E. Thiele suggested a doctrine of &ldquo;partial valencies,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
which assumes that in addition to the ordinary valencies, each
doubly linked atom has a partial valency, by which the atom first
interacts. When applied to benzene, a twofold conjugated
system is suggested in which the partial valencies of adjacent
atoms neutralize, with the formation of a potential double link.
The stability of benzene is ascribed to this conjugation.<a name="FnAnchor_14b" id="FnAnchor_14b" href="#Footnote_14b"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p>Physico-chemical properties have also been drawn upon to
decide whether double unions are present in the benzene
complex; but here the predilections of the observers
<span class="sidenote">Physico-chemical methods.</span>
apparently influence the nature of the conclusions to
be drawn from such data. It is well known that
singly, doubly and trebly linked carbon atoms affect
the physical properties of substances, such as the refractive
index, specific volume, and the heat of combustion; and by
determining these constants for many substances, fairly definite
values can be assigned to these groupings. The general question
of the relation of the refractive index to constitution has been
especially studied by J.W. Brühl, who concluded that benzene
contained 3 double linkages; whereas, in 1901, Pellini (<i>Gazetta</i>,
31, i. p. 1) calculated that 9 single linkages were present. A
similar contradiction apparently exists with regard to the
specific volume, for while benzene has a specific volume
corresponding to Claus&rsquo; formula, toluene, or methylbenzene, rather
points to Kekulé&rsquo;s. The heat of combustion, as first determined
by Julius Thomsen, agreed rather better with the presence of
nine single unions. His work was repeated on a finer scale by
M.P.E. Berthelot of Paris, and F.C.A. Stohmann of Leipzig;
and the new data and the conclusions to be drawn from them
formed the subject of much discussion, Brühl endeavouring
to show how they supported Kekulé&rsquo;s formula, while Thomsen
maintained that they demanded the benzene union to have a
different heat of combustion from the acetylene union. Thomsen
then investigated heats of combustion of various benzenoid
hydrocarbons&mdash;benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene,
&amp;c.&mdash;in the crystallized state. It was found that the results
were capable of expression by the empirical relation
C<span class="su">a</span>H<span class="su">2b</span> = 104.3b + 49.09m + 105.47n, where C<span class="su">a</span>H<span class="su">2b</span> denotes the
formula of the hydrocarbon, m the number of single carbon linkings and
n the number of double linkings, m and n being calculated on
the Kekulé formulae. But, at the same time, the constants in
the above relation are not identical with those in the corresponding
relation empirically deduced from observations on fatty
hydrocarbons; and we are therefore led to conclude that a
benzene union is considerably more stable than an ethylene union.</p>

<p>Mention may be made of the absorption spectrum of benzene.
According to W.N. Hartley (<i>J.C.S.</i>, 1905, 87, p. 1822), there
are six bands in the ultra-violet, while E.C.C. Baly and J.N.
Collie (<i>J.C.S.</i>, 1905, 87, p. 1332; 1906, 89, p. 524) record seven.
These bands are due to molecular oscillations; Hartley suggests
the carbon atoms to be rotating and forming alternately single
and double linkages, the formation of three double links giving
three bands, and of three single links another three; Baly and
Collie, on the other hand, suggest the making and breaking of
links between adjacent atoms, pointing out that there are seven
combinations of one, two and three pairs of carbon atoms in the
benzene molecule.</p>

<p><i>Stereo-chemical Configurations.</i>&mdash;Simultaneously with the
discussions of Kekulé, Ladenburg, Claus, Baeyer and others as to the
merits of various plane formulae of the benzene complex, there
were published many suggestions with regard to the arrangement
of the atoms in space, all of which attempted to explain
the number of isomers and the equivalence of the hydrogen
atoms. The development of stereo-isomerism at the hands of
J. Wislicenus, Le Bel and van &rsquo;t Hoff has resulted in the introduction
of another condition which formulae for the benzene
complex must satisfy, viz. that the hydrogen atoms must all
lie in one plane. The proof of this statement rests on the fact
that if the hydrogen atoms were not co-planar, then substitution
derivatives (the substituting groups not containing asymmetric
carbon atoms) should exist in enantiomorphic forms, differing in
crystal form and in their action on polarized light; such optical
antipodes have, however, not yet been separated. Ladenburg&rsquo;s
prism formula would give two enantiomorphic ortho-di-substitution
derivatives; while forms in which the hydrogen atoms
are placed at the corners of a regular octahedron would yield
enantiomorphic tri-substitution derivatives.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The octahedral formula discussed by Julius Thomsen (<i>Ber.</i>, 1886,
19, p. 2944) consists of the six carbon atoms placed at the corners
of a regular octahedron, and connected together by the full lines as
shown in (I); a plane projection gives a hexagon with diagonals
(II). Reduction to hexamethylene compounds necessitates the
disruption of three of the edges of the octahedron, the diagonal
linkings remaining intact, or, in the plane projection, three peripheral
linkages, the hexamethylene ring assuming the form (III):</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:350px; height:161px" src="images/img57a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In 1888 J.E. Marsh published a paper (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> [V.], 26, p. 426)
in which he discussed various stereo-chemical representations of
the benzene nucleus. (The stereo-chemistry of carbon compounds
has led to the spatial representation of a carbon atom as being
situated at the centre of a tetrahedron, the four valencies being
directed towards the apices; see above, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Isomerism</a></span>.) A form
based on Kekulé&rsquo;s formula consists in taking three pairs of tetrahedra,
each pair having a side in common, and joining them up
along the sides of a regular hexagon by means of their apices. This
form, afterwards supported by Carl Graebe (<i>Ber.</i>, 1902, 35, p. 526; see
also Marsh&rsquo;s reply, <i>Journ. Chem. Soc. Trans.</i>, 1902, p. 961) shows
the proximity of the ortho-positions, but fails to explain the identity
of 1·2 and 1·6 compounds. Arrangements connected with Claus&rsquo;
formula are obtained by placing six tetrahedra on the six triangles
formed by the diagonals of a plane hexagon. The form in which the
tetrahedra are all on one side, afterwards discussed by J. Loschmidt
(<i>Monats.</i>, 1890, II, p. 28), would not give stereo-isomers; and the
arrangement of placing the tetrahedra on alternate sides, a form
afterwards developed by W. Vaubel (<i>Journ. Pr. Chem.</i>, 1894[2],
49, p. 308), has the advantage of bringing the meta-positions on one
side, and the ortho- and para- on opposite sides, thus exhibiting
the similarity actually observed between these series of compounds.
Marsh also devised a form closely resembling that of Thomsen,
inasmuch as the carbon atoms occupied the angles of a regular
octahedron, and the diagonal linkages differed in nature from
the peripheral, but differing from Thomsen&rsquo;s since rupture of the
diagonal and not peripheral bonds accompanied the reduction to
hexamethylene.</p>

<p>We may also notice the model devised by H. Sachse (<i>Ber.</i>, 1888,
21, 2530; <i>Zeit. fur phys. Chem.</i>, II, p. 214; 23, p. 2062). Two
parallel triangular faces are removed from a cardboard model of a
regular octahedron, and on the remaining six faces tetrahedra are
then placed; the hydrogen atoms are at the free angles. This
configuration is, according to Sachse, more stable than any other
form; no oscillation is possible, the molecule being only able to
move as a whole. In 1897, J.N. Collie (<i>Journ. Chem. Soc. Trans.</i>,
p. 1013) considered in detail an octahedral form, and showed how by
means of certain simple rotations of his system the formulae
of Kekulé and Claus could be obtained as projections. An entirely
new device, suggested by B. König (<i>Chem. Zeit.</i>, 1905, 29, p. 30),
assumed the six carbon atoms to occupy six of the corners of a cube,
each carbon atom being linked to a hydrogen atom and by single
bonds to two neighbouring carbon atoms, the remaining valencies
being directed to the unoccupied corners of the cube, three to each,
where they are supposed to satisfy each other.</p>
</div>

<p class="center1"><i>Condensed Nuclei.</i></p>

<p>Restricting ourselves to compounds resulting from the fusion
of benzene rings, we have first to consider naphthalene, C<span class="su">10</span>H<span class="su">8</span>,
which consists of two benzene rings having a pair of carbon atoms
in common. The next members are the isomers anthracene and
phenanthrene, C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>, formed from three benzene nuclei. Here
we shall only discuss the structure of these compounds in the
light of the modern benzene theories; reference should be made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
to the articles <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Naphthalene</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Anthracene</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Phenanthrene</a></span>
for syntheses, decompositions, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Naphthalene.</i>&mdash;Of the earlier suggestions for the constitution
of naphthalene we notice the formulae of Wreden (1) and (2),
Berthelot and Balls (3), R.A.C.E. Erlenmeyer (4) and Adolf
Claus (5).</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:450px; height:72px" src="images/img58a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first suggestion is quite out of the question. C. Graebe in
1866 (<i>Ann.</i> 149, p. 20) established the symmetry of the naphthalene
nucleus, and showed that whichever half of the molecule
be oxidized the same phthalic acid results. Therefore formula (2),
being unsymmetrical, is impossible. The third formula is based
on Dewar&rsquo;s benzene formula, which we have seen to be incorrect.
Formula (4) is symmetrical and based on Kekulé&rsquo;s formula: it
is in full accord with the syntheses and decompositions of the
naphthalene nucleus and the number of isomers found. In
1882 Claus suggested a combination of his own and Dewar&rsquo;s
benzene formulae. This is obviously unsymmetrical, consisting
of an aliphatic and an aromatic nucleus; Claus explained the
formation of the same phthalic acid from the oxidation of either
nucleus by supposing that if the aromatic group be oxidized, the
aliphatic residue assumes the character of a benzene nucleus.
Bamberger opposed Claus&rsquo; formula on the following grounds:&mdash;The
molecule of naphthalene is symmetrical, since 2.7 dioxynaphthalene
is readily esterified by methyl iodide and sulphuric
acid to a dimethyl ether; and no more than two mono-substitution
derivatives are known. The molecule is aromatic but not
benzenoid; however, by the reduction of one half of the molecule,
the other assumes a benzenoid character.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>If &beta;-naphthylamine and &beta;-naphthol be reduced, tetrahydro
products are obtained in which the amino- or oxy-bearing half of
the molecule becomes aliphatic in character. The compounds so
obtained, alicyclic-&beta;-tetrahydronaphthylamine and alicyclic-&beta;-tetrahydronaphthol,
closely resemble &beta;-aminodiethylbenzene,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)·C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">4</span>NH<span class="su">2</span>, and &beta;-oxydiethylbenzene, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)·C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">4</span>OH.
If &alpha;-naphthylamine and &alpha;-naphthol be reduced, the hydrogen atoms
attach themselves to the non-substituted half of the molecule,
and the compounds so obtained resemble aminodiethylbenzene,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>·NH<span class="su">2</span>(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">2</span> and oxydiethylbenzene, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">3</span>·OH(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">2</span>.  Bamberger&rsquo;s
observations on reduced quinoline derivatives point to the
same conclusion, that condensed nuclei are not benzenoid, but
possess an individual character, which breaks down, however, when
the molecule is reduced.</p>
</div>

<p>It remains, therefore, to consider Erlenmeyer&rsquo;s formula and
those derived from the centric hypothesis. The former, based
on Kekulé&rsquo;s symbol for benzene, explains the decompositions
and syntheses of the ring, but the character of naphthalene
is not in keeping with the presence of five double linkages,
although it is more readily acted upon than benzene is. On the
centric hypothesis two formulae are possible: (i) due to H.E.
Armstrong, and (2) due to E. Bamberger.</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:151px; height:75px" src="images/img58b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">In the first symbol it is assumed that one of the affinities of each
of the two central carbon atoms common to the two rings <i>acts
into</i> both rings, an assumption involving a somewhat wide
departure from all ordinary views as to the manner in which
affinity acts. This symbol harmonizes with the fact that the two
rings are in complete sympathy, the one responding to every
change made in the other. Then, on account of the relatively
slight&mdash;because divided&mdash;influence which would be exercised
upon the two rings by the two affinities common to both, the
remaining four centric affinities of each ring would presumably
be less attracted into the ring than in the case of benzene;
consequently they would be more active outwards, and combination
would set in more readily.  When, as in the formation
of naphthalene tetrachloride, for example, the one ring becomes
saturated, the other might be expected to assume the normal
centric form and become relatively inactive. This is absolutely
the case. On the other hand, if substitution be effected in the
one ring, and the affinities in that ring become attracted inwards,
as apparently happens in the case of benzene, the adjoining ring
should become relatively more active because the common
affinities would act less into it. Hence, unless the radical
introduced be one which exercises a special attractive influence,
substitution should take place in preference in the previously
unsubstituted ring. In practice this usually occurs; for example,
on further bromination, &alpha;-bromonaphthalene yields a mixture
of the (1.4) and (1.5) dibromonaphthalenes; and when nitronaphthalene
is either brominated, or nitrated or sulphonated,
the action is practically confined to the second ring. The
centric formula proposed by Bamberger represents naphthalene as
formed by the fusion of two benzene rings, this indicates that it
is a monocyclic composed of ten atoms of carbon. The formula
has the advantage that it may be constructed from tetrahedral
models of the carbon atom; but it involves the assumption that
the molecule has within it a mechanism, equivalent in a measure
to a system of railway points, which can readily close up and
pass into that characteristic of benzene.</p>

<p><i>Anthracene and Phenanthrene.</i>&mdash;These isomeric hydrocarbons,
of the formula C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>, are to be regarded as formed by the
fusion of three benzenoid rings as represented by the symbols:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:273px; height:75px" src="images/img58c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">In both cases the medial ring is most readily attacked; and
various formulae have been devised which are claimed by their
authors to represent this and other facts. According to Armstrong,
anthracene behaves unsymmetrically towards substituents,
and hence one lateral ring differs from the other; he
represents the molecule as consisting of one centric ring, the
remaining medial and lateral ring being ethenoid. Bamberger,
on the other hand, extends his views on benzene and naphthalene
and assumes the molecule to be (1). For general purposes,
however, the symbol (2), in which the lateral rings are benzenoid
and the medial ring fatty, represents quite adequately the
syntheses, decompositions, and behaviour of anthracene.</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:217px; height:75px" src="images/img58d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Phenanthrene is regarded by Armstrong as represented by (3),
the lateral rings being benzenoid, and the medial ring fatty;
Bamberger, however, regards it as (4), the molecule being
entirely aromatic. An interesting observation by Baeyer, viz.
that stilbene, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·CH:CH·C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>, is very readily oxidized,
while phenanthrene is not, supports, in some measure, the views
of Bamberger.</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:285px; height:80px" src="images/img58e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="center1"><i>Heterocyclic Compounds.</i></p>

<p>During recent years an immense number of ringed or cyclic
compounds have been discovered, which exhibit individual
characters more closely resembling benzene, naphthalene, &amp;c.
than purely aliphatic substances, inasmuch as in general they
contain double linkages, yet withstand oxidation, and behave as
nuclei, forming derivatives in much the same way as benzene.
By reduction, the double linkages become saturated, and
compounds result which stand in much about the same relation
to the original nucleus as hexamethylene does to benzene. In
general, therefore, it may be considered that the double linkages
are not of exactly the same nature as the double linkage present
in ethylene and ethylenoid compounds, but that they are
analogous to the potential valencies of benzene. The centric
hypothesis has been applied to these rings by Bamberger and
others; but as in the previous rings considered, the ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
representation with double and single linkages generally represents
the syntheses, decompositions, &amp;c.; exceptions, however,
are known where it is necessary to assume an oscillation of the
double linkage. Five- and six-membered rings are the most
stable and important, the last-named group resulting from the
polymerization of many substances; three- and four-membered
rings are formed with difficulty, and are easily ruptured; rings
containing seven or more members are generally unstable, and
are relatively little known. The elements which go to form
heterocyclic rings, in addition to carbon, are oxygen, sulphur,
selenium and nitrogen. It is remarkable that sulphur can
replace two methine or CH groups with the production of compounds
greatly resembling, the original one. Thus benzene,
(CH)<span class="su">6</span>, gives thiophene, (CH)<span class="su">4</span>S, from which it is difficultly distinguished;
pyridine, (CH)<span class="su">5</span>N, gives thiazole, (CH)<span class="su">3</span>·N·S, which
is a very similar substance; naphthalene gives thionaphthen,
C<span class="su">8</span>H<span class="su">6</span>S, with which it shows great analogies, especially in the
derivatives. Similarly a CH group may be replaced by a nitrogen
atom with the production of compounds of similar stability;
thus benzene gives pyridine, naphthalene gives quinoline and
isoquinoline; anthracene gives acridine and &alpha; and &beta; anthrapyridines.
Similarly, two or more methine groups may be
replaced by the same number of nitrogen atoms with the formation
of rings of considerable stability.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Most of the simple ring systems which contain two adjacent
carbon atoms may suffer fusion with any other ring (also containing
two adjacent carbon atoms) with the production of nuclei of greater
complexity. Such <i>condensed nuclei</i> are, in many cases, more readily
obtained than the parent nucleus. The more important types are
derived from aromatic nuclei, benzene, naphthalene, &amp;c.; the
ortho-di-derivatives of the first named, lending themselves particularly
to the formation of condensed nuclei. Thus ortho-phenylene
diamine yields the following products:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:580px; height:80px" src="images/img59a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In some cases oxidation of condensed benzenoid-heterocyclic nuclei
results in the rupture of the heterocyclic ring with the formation of
a benzene dicarboxylic acid; but if the aromatic nucleus be weakened
by the introduction of an amino group, then it is the benzenoid
nucleus which is destroyed and a dicarboxylic acid of the heterocyclic
ring system obtained.</p>
</div>

<p>Heterocyclic rings may be systematically surveyed from two
aspects: (1) by arranging the rings with similar hetero-atoms
according to the increasing number of carbon atoms, the so-called
&ldquo;homologous series&rdquo;; or (2) by first dividing the ring systems
according to the number of members constituting the ring, and
then classifying these groups according to the nature of the
hetero-atoms, the so-called &ldquo;isologous series.&rdquo; The second
method possesses greater advantages, for rings of approximate
stability come in one group, and, consequently, their derivatives
may be expected to exhibit considerable analogies.</p>

<p>As a useful preliminary it is convenient to divide heterocyclic
ring systems into two leading groups: (1) systems resulting
from simple internal dehydration (or similar condensations) of
saturated aliphatic compounds&mdash;such compounds are: the
internal anhydrides or cyclic ethers of the glycols and thioglycols
(ethylene oxide, &amp;c.); the cyclic alkyleneimides resulting from
the splitting off of ammonia between the amino groups of diamino-paraffins
(pyrrolidine, piperazine, &amp;c.); the cyclic esters of
oxycarboxylic acids (lactones, lactides); the internal anhydrides
of aminocarboxylic acids (lactams, betaines); cyclic derivatives
of dicarboxylic acids (anhydrides, imides, alkylen-esters, alkylen-amides,
&amp;c.). These compounds retain their aliphatic nature,
and are best classified with open-chain compounds, into which,
in general, they are readily converted. (2) Systems which
are generally unsaturated compounds, often of considerable
stability, and behave as nuclei; these compounds constitute a
well-individualized class exhibiting closer affinities to benzenoid
substances than to the open-chain series.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The transition between the two classes as differentiated above
may be illustrated by the following cyclic compounds, each of which
contains a ring composed of four carbon atoms and one oxygen
atom:</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:600px; height:91px" src="images/img59b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">The first four substances are readily formed from, and converted
into, the corresponding dihydroxy open-chain compound; these
substances are truly aliphatic in character. The fifth compound,
on the other hand, does not behave as an unsaturated aliphatic
compound, but its deportment is that of a nucleus, many substitution
derivatives being capable of synthesis. Reduction, however, converts
it into an aliphatic compound. This is comparable with the
reduction of the benzene nucleus into hexamethylene, a substance of
an aliphatic character.</p>
</div>

<p>True ring systems, which possess the characters of organic
nuclei, do not come into existence in three-and four-membered
rings, their first appearance being in penta-atomic rings. The
three primary members are furfurane, thiophene and pyrrol,
each of which contains four methine or CH groups, and an
oxygen, sulphur and imido (NH) member respectively; a
series of compounds containing selenium is also known. The
formulae of these substances are:</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:550px; height:83px" src="images/img59c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">By substituting one or more CH groups in these compounds
by nitrogen atoms, ring-systems, collectively known as <i>azoles</i>,
result. Obviously, isomeric ring-systems are possible, since the
carbon atoms in the original rings are not all of equal value.
Thus furfurane yields the following rings by the introduction
of one and two nitrogen atoms:</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:436px; height:160px" src="images/img59d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">Thiophene yields a similar series: isothiazole (only known as
the condensed ring, isobenzothiazole), thiazole, diazosulphides,
piazthioles, azosulphimes and thiobiazole (the formulae are
easily derived from the preceding series by replacing oxygen by
sulphur). Thiophene also gives rise to triazsulphole, three
nitrogen atoms being introduced. Selenophene gives the series:
selenazole, diazoselenide and piaselenole, corresponding to
oxazole, diazo-oxides and furazane. Pyrrol yields an analogous
series: pyrazole, imidazole or glyoxaline, azimide or osotriazole,
triazole and tetrazole:</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:539px; height:160px" src="images/img59e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Six-membered ring systems can be referred back, in a manner
similar to the above, to pyrone, penthiophene and pyridine, the
substances containing a ring of five carbon atoms, and an
oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen atom respectively. As before,
only <i>true</i> ring nuclei, and not internal anhydrides of aliphatic
compounds, will be mentioned. From the pyrone ring the
following series of compounds are derived (for brevity, the
hydrogen atoms are not printed):</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:97px" src="images/img59f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">Penthiophene gives, by a similar introduction of nitrogen atoms,
penthiazoline, corresponding to meta-oxazine, and para-thiazine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
corresponding to paroxazine (para-oxazine). Pyridine gives
origin to: pyridazine or ortho-diazine, pyrimidine or meta-diazine,
pyrazine or para-diazine, osotriazine, <i>unsymmetrical</i>
triazine, <i>symmetrical</i> triazine, osotetrazone and tetrazine. The
skeletons of these types are (the carbon atoms are omitted for
brevity):</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:550px; height:93px" src="images/img60a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We have previously referred to the condensation of heterocyclic
ring systems containing two vicinal carbon atoms with
benzene, naphthalene and other nuclei. The more important
nuclei of this type have received special and non-systematic
names; when this is not the case, such terms as phen-, benzo-,
naphtho- are prefixed to the name of the heterocyclic ring. One
or two benzene nuclei may suffer condensation with the furfurane,
thiophene and pyrrol rings, the common carbon atoms being
vicinal to the hetero-atom. The mono-benzo-derivatives are
coumarone, benzothiophene and indole; the dibenzo-derivatives
are diphenylene oxide, dibenzothiophene or diphenylene sulphide,
and carbazole. Typical formulae are (R denoting O, S or NH):</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:199px; height:70px" src="images/img60b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">Isomers are possible, for the condensation may be effected on
the two carbon atoms symmetrically placed to the hetero-atom;
these isomers, however, are more of the nature of internal
anhydrides. Benz-oxazoles and -thiazoles have been prepared,
benz-isoxazoles are known as indoxazenes; benzo-pyrazoles
occur in two structural forms, named indazoles and isindazoles.
Derivatives of osotriazol also exist in two forms&mdash;azimides and
pseudo-azimides.</p>

<p>Proceeding to the six-membered hetero-atomic rings, the
benzo-, dibenzo- and naphtho-derivatives are frequently of
great commercial and scientific importance, &alpha;-pyrone condenses
with the benzene ring to form coumarin and isocoumarin;
benzo-&gamma;-pyrone constitutes the nucleus of several vegetable
colouring matters (chrysin, fisetin, quercetin, &amp;c., which are
derivatives of flavone or phenyl benzo-&gamma;-pyrone); dibenzo-&gamma;-pyrone
is known as xanthone; related to this substance are
fluorane (and fluorescein), fluorone, fluorime, pyronine, &amp;c.
The pyridine ring condenses with the benzene ring to form
quinoline and isoquinoline; acridine and phenanthridine are
dibenzo-pyridines; naphthalene gives rise to &alpha;- and &beta;-naphthoquinolines
and the anthrapyridines; anthracene gives anthraquinoline;
while two pyridine nuclei connected by an intermediate
benzene nucleus give the phenanthrolines. Naphthyridines
and naphthinolines result from the condensation of
two pryridine and two quinoline nuclei respectively; and
quino-quinolines are unsymmetrical naphthyridine nuclei
condensed with a benzene nucleus. Benzo-orthoxazines, -metoxazines
and -paroxazines are known: dibenzoparoxazine
or phenoxazine is the parent of a valuable series of dyestuffs;
dibenzoparathiazine or thiodiphenylamine is important from
the same aspect. Benzo-ortho-diazines exist in two structural
forms, cinnolin and phthalazine; benzo-meta-diazines are
known as quinazolines; benzo-para-diazines are termed quinoxalines;
the dibenzo-compounds are named phenazines, this last
group including many valuable dyestuffs&mdash;indulines, safranines,
&amp;c. In addition to the types of compounds enumerated above
we may also notice purin, tropine and the terpenes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center1 sc">V. ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY</p>

<p>This branch of chemistry has for its province the determination
of the constituents of a chemical compound or of a mixture of
compounds. Such a determination is <i>qualitative</i>, the constituent
being only detected or proved to be present, or <i>quantitative</i>, in
which the amount present is ascertained. The methods of
chemical analysis may be classified according to the type of
reaction: (1) <i>dry</i> or <i>blowpipe analysis</i>, which consists in an
examination of the substance in the dry condition; this includes
such tests as ignition in a tube, ignition on charcoal in the
blowpipe flame, fusion with borax, microcosmic salt or fluxes,
and flame colorations (in quantitative work the dry methods are
sometimes termed &ldquo;dry assaying&rdquo;); (2) <i>wet analysis</i>, in which
a solution of the substance is treated with reagents which
produce specific reactions when certain elements or groups of
elements are present.  In quantitative analysis the methods
can be subdivided into: (a) <i>gravimetric</i>, in which the constituent
is precipitated either as a definite insoluble compound by the
addition of certain reagents, or electrolytically, by the passage
of an electric current; (b) <i>volumetric</i>, in which the volume of a
reagent of a known strength which produces a certain definite
reaction is measured; (c) <i>colorimetric</i>, in which the solution has
a particular tint, which can be compared with solutions of
known strengths.</p>

<p><i>Historical.</i>&mdash;The germs of analytical chemistry are to be
found in the writings of the pharmacists and chemists of the
iatrochemical period. The importance of ascertaining the
proximate composition of bodies was clearly realized by Otto
Tachenius; but the first systematic investigator was Robert
Boyle, to whom we owe the introduction of the term <i>analysis</i>.
Boyle recognized many reagents which gave precipitates with
certain solutions: he detected sulphuric and hydrochloric
acids by the white precipitates formed with calcium chloride
and silver nitrate respectively; ammonia by the white cloud
formed with the vapours of nitric or hydrochloric acids; and
copper by the deep blue solution formed by a solution of ammonia.
Of great importance is his introduction of vegetable juices (the
so-called <i>indicators</i>, <i>q.v.</i>) to detect acids and bases. During the
phlogistic period, the detection of the constituents of compounds
was considerably developed. Of the principal workers in this
field we may notice Friedrich Hoffmann, Andreas Sigismund
Marggraf (who detected iron by its reaction with potassium
ferrocyanide, and potassium and sodium by their flame colorations),
and especially Carl Scheele and Torbern Olof Bergman.
Scheele enriched the knowledge of chemistry by an immense
number of facts, but he did not possess the spirit of working
systematically as Bergman did. Bergman laid the foundations
of systematic qualitative analysis, and devised methods by which
the metals may be separated into groups according to their
behaviour with certain reagents.  This subdivision, which is of
paramount importance in the analysis of minerals, was subsequently
developed by Wilhelm August Lampadius in his <i>Handbuch
zur chemischen Analyse der Mineralien</i> (1801) and by John
Friedrich A. Göttling in his <i>Praktische Anleitung zur prüfenden
und zurlegenden Chemie</i> (1802).</p>

<p>The introduction of the blowpipe into dry qualitative analysis
by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt marks an important innovation.
The rapidity of the method, and the accurate results which it
gave in the hands of a practised experimenter, led to its systematization
by Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Johann Friedrich Ludwig
Hausmann, and in more recent times by K.F. Plattner, whose
treatise <i>Die Probirkunst mit dem Löthrohr</i> is a standard work on
the subject.  Another type of dry reaction, namely, the <i>flame
coloration</i>, had been the subject of isolated notices, as, for example,
the violet flame of potassium and the orange flame of sodium
observed by Marggraf and Scheele, but a systematic account was
wanting until Cartmell took the subject up.  His results (<i>Phil.
Mag.</i> 16, p. 382) were afterwards perfected by Robert Wilhelm
Bunsen and Gustav Merz.  Closely related to the flame-colorations,
we have to notice the great services rendered by the
spectroscope to the detection of elements. Rubidium, caesium,
thallium, indium and gallium were first discovered by means of
this instrument; the study of the rare earths is greatly facilitated,
and the composition of the heavenly bodies alone determinable
by it.</p>

<p>Quantitative chemistry had been all but neglected before
the time of Lavoisier, for although a few chemists such as
Tachenius, Bergman and others had realized the advantages
which would accrue from a knowledge of the composition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
bodies by weight, and had laid down the lines upon which such
determinations should proceed, the experimental difficulties in
making accurate observations were enormous, and little progress
could be made until the procedure was more accurately
determined.  Martin Heinrich Klaproth showed the necessity for
igniting precipitates before weighing them, if they were not
decomposed by this process; and he worked largely with Louis
Nicolas Vauquelin in perfecting the analysis of minerals.  K.F.
Wenzel and J.B. Richter contributed to the knowledge of the
quantitative composition of salts. Anton Laurent Lavoisier,
however, must be considered as the first great exponent of this
branch of chemistry.  He realized that the composition by
weight of chemical compounds was of the greatest moment if
chemistry were to advance.  His fame rests upon his exposition
of the principles necessary to chemistry as a <span class="correction" title="amended from secience">science</span>, but of his
contributions to analytical inorganic chemistry little can be said.
He applied himself more particularly to the oxygen compounds,
and determined with a fair degree of accuracy the ratio of carbon
to oxygen in carbon dioxide, but his values for the ratio of hydrogen
to oxygen in water, and of phosphorus to oxygen in phosphoric
acid, are only approximate; he introduced no new methods
either for the estimation or separation of the metals.  The next
advance was made by Joseph Louis Proust, whose investigations
led to a clear grasp of the law of constant proportions. The
formulation of the atomic theory by John Dalton gave a fresh
impetus to the development of quantitative analysis; and the
determination of combining or equivalent weights by Berzelius
led to the perfecting of the methods of gravimetric analysis.
Experimental conditions were thoroughly worked out; the
necessity of working with hot or cold solutions was clearly
emphasized; and the employment of small quantities of
substances instead of the large amounts recommended by
Klaproth was shown by him to give more consistent results.</p>

<p>Since the time of Berzelius many experimenters have entered
the lists, and introduced developments which we have not space
to mention. We may, however, notice Heinrich Rose<a name="FnAnchor_15b" id="FnAnchor_15b" href="#Footnote_15b"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and
Friedrich Wohler,<a name="FnAnchor_16b" id="FnAnchor_16b" href="#Footnote_16b"><span class="sp">16</span></a> who, having worked up the results of their
teacher Berzelius, and combined them with their own valuable
observations, exerted great influence on the progress of analytical
chemistry by publishing works which contained admirable
accounts of the then known methods of analysis. To K.R.
Fresenius, the founder of the <i>Zeitschrift für analytische Chemie</i>
(1862), we are particularly indebted for perfecting and systematizing
the various methods of analytical chemistry. By strengthening
the older methods, and devising new ones, he exerted an
influence which can never be overestimated. His text-books on
the subject, of which the <i>Qualitative</i> appeared in 1841, and the
<i>Quantitative</i> in 1846, have a world-wide reputation, and have
passed through several editions.</p>

<p>The quantitative precipitation of metals by the electric current,
although known to Michael Faraday, was not applied to analytical
chemistry until O. Wolcott Gibbs worked out the electrolytic
separation of copper in 1865. Since then the subject has been
extensively studied, more particularly by Alexander Classen, who
has summarized the methods and results in his <i>Quantitative
Chemical Analysis by Electrolysis</i> (1903). The ever-increasing
importance of the electric current in metallurgy and chemical
manufactures is making this method of great importance, and in
some cases it has partially, if not wholly, superseded the older
methods.</p>

<p>Volumetric analysis, possessing as it does many advantages
over the gravimetric methods, has of late years been extensively
developed. Gay Lussac may be regarded as the founder of the
method, although rough applications had been previously made
by F.A.H. Descroizilles and L.N. Vauquelin. Chlorimetry
(1824), alkalimetry (1828), and the volumetric determination of
silver and chlorine (1832) were worked out by Gay Lussac; but
although the advantages of the method were patent, it received
recognition very slowly. The application of potassium permanganate
to the estimation of iron by E. Margueritte in 1846,
and of iodine and sulphurous acid to the estimation of copper and
many other substances by Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, marks an
epoch in the early history of volumetric analysis. Since then it
has been rapidly developed, particularly by Karl Friedrich Mohr
and J. Volhard, and these methods rank side by side in value
with the older and more tedious gravimetric methods.</p>

<p>The detection of carbon and hydrogen in organic compounds
by the formation of carbon dioxide and water when they are
burned was first correctly understood by Lavoisier, and as he
had determined the carbon and hydrogen content of these two
substances he was able to devise methods by which carbon and
hydrogen in organic compounds could be estimated. In his
earlier experiments he burned the substance in a known volume
of oxygen, and by measuring the residual gas determined the
carbon and hydrogen. For substances of a difficultly combustible
nature he adopted the method in common use to-day, viz. to mix
the substance with an oxidizing agent&mdash;mercuric oxide, lead
dioxide, and afterwards copper oxide&mdash;and absorb the carbon
dioxide in potash solution. This method has been improved,
especially by Justus v. Liebig; and certain others based on a
different procedure have been suggested. The estimation of
nitrogen was first worked out in 1830 by Jean Baptiste Dumas,
and different processes have been proposed by Will and F.
Varrentrapp, J. Kjeldahl and others. Methods for the estimation
of the halogens and sulphur were worked out by L. Carius (see
below, § <i>Organic Analysis</i>).</p>

<p>Only a reference can be made in this summary to the many
fields in which analytical chemistry has been developed. Progress
in forensic chemistry was only possible after the reactions
of poisons had been systematized; a subject which has been
worked out by many investigators, of whom we notice K.R.
Fresenius, J. and R. Otto, and J.S. Stas. Industrial chemistry
makes many claims upon the chemist, for it is necessary to determine
the purity of a product before it can be valued. This has
led to the estimation of sugar by means of the polarimeter, and
of the calorific power of fuels, and the valuation of ores and
metals, of coal-tar dyes, and almost all trade products.</p>

<p>The passing of the Food and Drug Acts (1875-1899) in England,
and the existence of similar adulteration acts in other countries,
have occasioned great progress in the analysis of foods, drugs, &amp;c.
For further information on this branch of analytical chemistry,
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Adulteration</a></span>.</p>

<p>There exists no branch of technical chemistry, hygiene or
pharmacy from which the analytical chemist can be spared,
since it is only by a continual development of his art that we can
hope to be certain of the purity of any preparation. In England
this branch of chemistry is especially cared for by the Institute
of Chemistry, which, since its foundation in 1877, has done much
for the training of analytical chemists.</p>

<p>In the preceding sketch we have given a necessarily brief
account of the historical development of analytical chemistry in
its main branches. We shall now treat the different methods in
more detail. It must be mentioned here that the reactions of
any particular substance are given under its own heading, and in
this article we shall only collate the various operations and outline
the general procedure. The limits of space prevent any systematic
account of the separation of the rare metals, the alkaloids,
and other classes of organic compounds, but sources where these
matters may be found are given in the list of references.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Qualitative Inorganic Analysis.</i></p>

<p>The dry examination of a substance comprises several operations,
which may yield definite results if no disturbing
element is present; but it is imperative that any inference
<span class="sidenote">Dry methods.</span>
should be confirmed by other methods.</p>

<p>1. Heat the substance in a hard glass tube. Note whether
any moisture condenses on the cooler parts of the tube, a gas is
evolved, a sublimate formed, or the substance changes colour.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Moisture is evolved from substances containing water of crystallization
or decomposed hydrates. If it possesses an alkaline or
acid reaction, it must be tested in the first case for ammonia, and
in the second case for a volatile acid, such as sulphuric, nitric,
hydrochloric, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
Any evolved gas must be examined. Oxygen, recognized by its
power of igniting a glowing splinter, results from the decomposition
of oxides of the noble metals, peroxides, chlorates, nitrates and other
highly oxygenized salts. Sulphur dioxide, recognized by its smell
and acid reaction, results from the ignition of certain sulphites,
sulphates, or a mixture of a sulphate with a sulphide. Nitrogen
oxides, recognized by their odour and brown-red colour, result from
the decomposition of nitrates. Carbon dioxide, recognized by
turning lime-water milky, indicates decomposable carbonates or
oxalates. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine, each recognizable by its
colour and odour, result from decomposable haloids; iodine forms
also a black sublimate. Cyanogen and hydrocyanic acid, recognizable
by their odour, indicate decomposable cyanides. Sulphuretted
hydrogen, recognized by its odour, results from sulphides containing
water, and hydrosulphides. Ammonia, recognizable by its odour
and alkaline reaction, indicates ammoniacal salts or cyanides
containing water.</p>

<p>A sublimate may be formed of: sulphur&mdash;reddish-brown drops,
cooling to a yellow to brown solid, from sulphides or mixtures;
iodine&mdash;violet vapour, black sublimate, from iodides, iodic acid, or
mixtures; mercury and its compounds&mdash;metallic mercury forms
minute globules, mercuric sulphide is black and becomes red on
rubbing, mercuric chloride fuses before subliming, mercurous
chloride does not fuse, mercuric iodide gives a yellow sublimate;
arsenic and its compounds&mdash;metallic arsenic gives a grey mirror,
arsenious oxide forms white shining crystals, arsenic sulphides give
reddish-yellow sublimates which turn yellow on cooling; antimony
oxide fuses and gives a yellow acicular sublimate; lead chloride
forms a white sublimate after long and intense heating.</p>

<p>If the substance does not melt but changes colour, we may have
present: zinc oxide&mdash;from white to yellow, becoming white on
cooling; stannic oxide&mdash;white to yellowish brown, dirty white on
cooling; lead oxide&mdash;from white or yellowish-red to brownish-red,
yellow on cooling; bismuth oxide&mdash;from white or pale yellow to
orange-yellow or reddish-brown, pale yellow on cooling; manganese
oxide&mdash;from white or yellowish white to dark brown, remaining
dark brown on cooling (if it changes on cooling to a bright reddish-brown,
it indicates cadmium oxide); copper oxide&mdash;from bright
blue or green to black; ferrous oxide&mdash;from greyish-white to black;
ferric oxide&mdash;from brownish-red to black, brownish-red on cooling;
potassium chromate&mdash;yellow to dark orange, fusing at a red heat.</p>
</div>

<p>2. Heat the substance on a piece of charcoal in the reducing
flame of the blowpipe.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(&alpha;) The substance may fuse and be absorbed by the charcoal;
this indicates more particularly the alkaline metals.</p>

<p>(&beta;) An infusible white residue may be obtained, which may denote
barium, strontium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium or zinc. The
first three give characteristic flame colorations (see below); the last
three, when moistened with cobalt nitrate and re-ignited, give
coloured masses; aluminium (or silica) gives a brilliant blue; zinc
gives a green; whilst magnesium phosphates or arsenate (and to a
less degree the phosphates of the alkaline earths) give a violet mass.</p>

<p>A metallic globule with or without an incrustation may be obtained.
Gold and copper salts give a metallic bead without an incrustation.
If the incrustation be white and readily volatile, arsenic is present,
if more difficultly volatile and beads are present, antimony; zinc
gives an incrustation yellow whilst hot, white on cooling, and
volatilized with difficulty; tin gives a pale yellow incrustation,
which becomes white on cooling, and does not volatilize in either the
reducing or oxidizing flames; lead gives a lemon-yellow incrustation
turning sulphur-yellow on cooling, together with metallic malleable
beads; bismuth gives metallic globules and a dark orange-yellow
incrustation, which becomes lemon-yellow on cooling; cadmium
gives a reddish-brown incrustation, which is removed without
leaving a gleam by heating in the reducing flame; silver gives white
metallic globules and a dark-red incrustation.</p>
</div>

<p>3. Heat the substance with a bead of microcosmic salt or
borax on a platinum wire in the oxidizing flame.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(&alpha;) The substance dissolves readily and in quantity, forming a
bead which is clear when hot. If the bead is coloured we may have
present: cobalt, blue to violet; copper, green, blue on cooling;
in the reducing flame, red when cold; chromium, green, unaltered
in the reducing flame; iron, brownish-red, light-yellow or colourless
on cooling; in the reducing flame, red while hot, yellow on cooling,
greenish when cold; nickel, reddish to brownish-red, yellow to
reddish-yellow or colourless on cooling, unaltered in the reducing
flame; bismuth, yellowish-brown, light-yellow or colourless on
cooling; in the reducing flame, almost colourless, blackish-grey when
cold; silver, light yellowish to opal, somewhat opaque when cold;
whitish-grey in the reducing flame; manganese, amethyst red,
colourless in the reducing flame. If the hot bead is colourless and
remains clear on cooling, we may suspect the presence of antimony,
aluminium, zinc, cadmium, lead, calcium and magnesium. When
present in sufficient quantity the five last-named give enamel-white
beads; lead oxide in excess gives a yellowish bead. If the hot
colourless bead becomes enamel-white on cooling even when minute
quantities of the substances are employed, we may infer the presence
of barium or strontium.</p>

<p>(&beta;) The substance dissolves slowly and in small quantity, and forms
a colourless bead which remains so on cooling. Either silica or tin
may be present. If silica be present, it gives the iron bead when
heated with a little ferric oxide; if tin is present there is no change.
Certain substances, such as the precious metals, are quite insoluble in
the bead, but float about in it.</p>
</div>

<p>4. Hold a small portion of the substance moistened with
hydrochloric acid on a clean platinum wire in the fusion zone
of the Bunsen burner, and note any colour imparted to the flame.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Potassium gives a blue-violet flame which may be masked by the
colorations due to sodium, calcium and other elements. By
viewing the flame through an indigo prism it appears sky-blue,
violet and ultimately crimson, as the thickness of the prism is
increased. Other elements do not interfere with this method.
Sodium gives an intense and persistent yellow flame; lithium gives
a carmine coloration, and may be identified in the presence of sodium
by viewing through a cobalt glass or indigo prism; from potassium
it may be distinguished by its redder colour; barium gives a yellowish-green
flame, which appears bluish-green when viewed through green
glass; strontium gives a crimson flame which appears purple or rose
when viewed through blue glass; calcium gives an orange-red
colour which appears finch-green through green glass; indium
gives a characteristic bluish-violet flame; copper gives an intense
emerald-green coloration.</p>
</div>

<p>5. <i>Film Reactions.</i>&mdash;These reactions are practised in the
following manner:&mdash;A thread of asbestos is moistened and then
dipped in the substance to be tested; it is then placed in the
luminous point of the Bunsen flame, and a small porcelain basin
containing cold water placed immediately over the asbestos.
The formation of a film is noted. The operation is repeated with
the thread in the oxidizing flame.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Any film formed in the first case is metallic, in the second it is the
oxide. The metallic film is tested with 20% nitric acid and with
bleaching-powder solution. Arsenic is insoluble in the acid, but
immediately dissolves in the bleaching-powder. The black films of
antimony and bismuth and the grey mottled film of mercury are
slowly soluble in the acid, and untouched by bleaching-powder.
The black films of tin, lead and cadmium dissolve at once in the acid,
the lead film being also soluble in bleaching-powder. The oxide
films of antimony, arsenic, tin and bismuth are white, that of bismuth
slightly yellowish; lead yields a very pale yellow film, and cadmium
a brown one; mercury yields no oxide film. The oxide films (the
metallic one in the case of mercury) are tested with hydriodic acid,
and with ammonium sulphide, and from the changes produced the
film can be determined (see F.M. Perkin, <i>Qualitative Chemical
Analysis</i>, 1905).</p>
</div>

<p>Having completed the dry analysis we may now pass on to
the <i>wet</i> and more accurate investigation. It is first necessary
to get the substance into solution. Small portions
<span class="sidenote">Wet methods.</span>
should be successively tested with water, dilute hydrochloric
acid, dilute nitric acid, strong hydrochloric
acid, and a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, first in the
cold and then with warming. Certain substances are insoluble
in all these reagents, and other methods, such as the fusion with
sodium carbonate and potassium nitrate, and subsequent treatment
with an acid, must be employed. Some of these insoluble
compounds can be detected by their colour and particular reactions.
For further information on this subject, we refer the
readers to Fresenius&rsquo;s <i>Qualitative Analysis</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The procedure for the detection of metals in solution consists of
first separating them into groups and then examining each group
separately. For this purpose the cold solution is treated with
hydrochloric acid, which precipitates lead, silver and mercurous
salts as chlorides. The solution is filtered and treated with an excess
of sulphuretted hydrogen, either in solution or by passing in the gas;
this precipitates mercury (mercuric), any lead left over from the
first group, copper, bismuth, cadmium, arsenic, antimony and tin
as sulphides. The solution is filtered off, boiled till free of sulphuretted
hydrogen, and ammonium chloride and ammonia added. If
phosphoric acid is absent, aluminium, chromium and ferric hydrates
are precipitated. If, however, phosphoric acid is present in the
original substance, we may here obtain a precipitate of the phosphates
of the remaining metals, together with aluminium, chromium and
ferric hydrates. In this case, the precipitate is dissolved in as little
as possible hydrochloric acid and boiled with ammonium acetate,
acetic acid and ferric chloride. The phosphates of aluminium,
chromium and iron are precipitated, and the solution contains the
same metals as if phosphoric acid had been absent. To the filtrate
from the aluminium, iron and chromium precipitate, ammonia and
ammonium sulphide are added; the precipitate may contain nickel,
cobalt, zinc and manganese sulphides. Ammonium carbonate is
added to the filtrate; this precipitates calcium, strontium and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
barium. The solution contains magnesium, sodium and potassium,
which are separately distinguished by the methods given under their
own headings.</p>

<p>We now proceed with the examination of the various group
precipitates. The white precipitate formed by cold hydrochloric
acid is boiled with water, and the solution filtered while hot. Any
lead chloride dissolves, and may be identified by the yellow precipitate
formed with potassium chromate. To the residue add ammonia,
shake, then filter. Silver chloride goes into solution, and may be
precipitated by dilute nitric acid. The residue, which is black in
colour, consists of mercuroso-ammonium chloride, in which mercury
can be confirmed by its ordinary tests.</p>

<p>The precipitate formed by sulphuretted hydrogen may contain
the black mercuric, lead, and copper sulphides, dark-brown bismuth
sulphide, yellow cadmium and arsenious sulphides, orange-red
antimony sulphide, brown stannous sulphide, dull-yellow stannic
sulphide, and whitish sulphur, the last resulting from the oxidation
of sulphuretted hydrogen by ferric salts, chromates, &amp;c. Warming
with ammonium sulphide dissolves out the arsenic, antimony and
tin salts, which are reprecipitated by the addition of hydrochloric
acid to the ammonium sulphide solution. The precipitate is shaken
with ammonium carbonate, which dissolves the arsenic. Filter and
confirm arsenic in the solution by its particular tests. Dissolve the
residue in hydrochloric acid and test separately for antimony and
tin. The residue from the ammonium sulphide solution is warmed
with dilute nitric acid. Any residue consists of black mercuric
sulphide (and possibly white lead sulphate), in which mercury is
confirmed by its usual tests. The solution is evaporated with a
little sulphuric acid and well cooled. The white precipitate consists
of lead sulphate. To the filtrate add ammonia in excess; a white
precipitate indicates bismuth; if the solution be blue, copper is
present. Filter from the bismuth hydrate, and if copper is present,
add potassium cyanide till the colour is destroyed, then pass sulphuretted
hydrogen, and cadmium is precipitated as the yellow sulphide.
If copper is absent, then sulphuretted hydrogen can be passed
directly into the solution.</p>

<p>The next group precipitate may contain the white gelatinous
aluminium hydroxide, the greenish chromium hydroxide, reddish
ferric hydroxide, and possibly zinc and manganese hydroxides.
Treatment with casutic soda dissolves out aluminium hydroxide,
which is reprecipitated by the addition of ammonium chloride.
The remaining metals are tested for separately.</p>

<p>The next group may contain black nickel and cobalt sulphides,
flesh-coloured manganese sulphide, and white zinc sulphide. The
last two are dissolved out by cold, very dilute hydrochloric acid,
and the residue is tested for nickel and cobalt. The solution is
boiled till free from sulphuretted hydrogen and treated with excess
of sodium hydrate. A white precipitate rapidly turning brown
indicates manganese. The solution with ammonium sulphide gives
a white precipitate of zinc sulphide.</p>

<p>The next group may contain the white calcium, barium and
strontium carbonates. The flame coloration (see above) may give
information as to which elements are present. The carbonates are
dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and calcium sulphate solution is
added to a portion of the solution. An immediate precipitate
indicates barium; a precipitate on standing indicates strontium.
If barium is present, the solution of the carbonates in hydrochloric
acid is evaporated and digested with strong alcohol for some time;
barium chloride, which is nearly insoluble in alcohol, is thus separated,
the remainder being precipitated by a few drops of hydrofluosilicic
acid, and may be confirmed by the ordinary tests. The solution free
from barium is treated with ammonia and ammonium sulphate,
which precipitates strontium, and the calcium in the solution may be
identified by the white precipitate with ammonium oxalate.</p>
</div>

<p>Having determined the bases, it remains to determine the acid
radicals. There is no general procedure for these operations,
and it is customary to test for the acids separately by special
tests; these are given in the articles on the various acids. A
knowledge of the solubility of salts considerably reduces the
number of acids likely to be present, and affords evidence of great
value to the analyst (see A.M. Comey, <i>Dictionary of Chemical
Solubilities</i>.) In the above account we have indicated the procedure
adopted in the analysis of a complex mixture of salts.
It is unnecessary here to dwell on the precautions which can only
be conveniently acquired by experience; a sound appreciation
of analytical methods is only possible after the reactions and
characters of individual substances have been studied, and we
therefore refer the reader to the articles on the particular elements
and compounds for more information on this subject.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Quantitative Inorganic Analysis</i>.</p>

<p>Quantitative methods are divided into four groups, which we
now pass on to consider in the following sequence: (&alpha;) gravimetric,
(&beta;) volumetric, (&gamma;) electrolytic, (&delta;) colorimetric.</p>

<p>(&alpha;) <i>Gravimetric.</i>&mdash;This method is made up of four operations:
(1) a weighed quantity of the substance is dissolved in a suitable
solvent; (2) a particular reagent is added which precipitates
the substance it is desired to estimate; (3) the precipitate is
filtered, washed and dried; (4) the filter paper containing the
precipitate is weighed either as a <i>tared</i> filter, or incinerated and
ignited either in air or in any other gas, and then weighed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) Accurate weighing is all-important: for details of the various
appliances and methods see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Weighing Machines</a></span>. (2) No general
directions can be given as to the method of precipitation. Sometimes
it is necessary to allow the solution to stand for a considerable time
either in the warm or cold or in the light or dark; to work with cold
solutions and then boil; or to use boiling solutions of both the
substance and reagent. Details will be found in the articles on
particular metals. (3) The operation of filtration and washing is
very important. If the substance to be weighed changes in composition
on strong heating, it is necessary to employ a tared filter,
i.e. a filter paper which has been previously heated to the temperature
at which the substance is to be dried until its weight is constant.
If the precipitate settles readily, the supernatant liquor may be
decanted through the filter paper, more water added to the
precipitate and again decanted. By this means most of the washing,
i.e.freeing from the other substances in the solution, can be
accomplished in the precipitating vessel. If, however, the precipitate
refuses to settle, it is directly transferred to the filter paper, the
last traces being removed by washing and rubbing the sides of the vessel
with a piece of rubber, and the liquid is allowed to drain through.
It is washed by ejecting a jet of water, ammonia or other prescribed
liquid on to the side of the filter paper until the paper is nearly full.
It can be shown that a more efficient washing results from alternately
filling and emptying the funnel than by endeavouring to keep the
funnel full. The washing is continued until the filtrate is free from
salts or acids. (4) After washing, the funnel containing the filter paper
is transferred to a drying oven. In the case of a tared filter it is
weighed repeatedly until the weight suffers no change; then knowing
the weight of the filter paper, the weight of the precipitate is obtained
by subtraction. If the precipitate may be ignited, it is transferred
to a clean, weighed and recently ignited crucible, and the filter paper
is burned <i>separately</i> on the lid, the ash transferred to the crucible,
and the whole ignited. After ignition, it is allowed to cool in a
desiccator and then weighed. Knowing the weight of the crucible
and of the ash of the filter paper, the weight of the precipitate is
determined. The calculation of the percentage of the particular
constituent is simple. We know the amount present in the precipitate,
and since the same amount is present in the quantity of substance
experimented with, we have only to work out a sum in proportion.</p>
</div>

<p>(&beta;) <i>Volumetric.</i>&mdash;This method is made up of three
operations:&mdash;(1) preparation of a <i>standard</i> solution; (2) preparation of a
solution of the substance; (3) <i>titration</i>, or the determination of
what volume of the standard solution will occasion a known
and definite reaction with a known volume of the test solution.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>(1) In general analytical work the standard solution contains the
equivalent weight of the substance in grammes dissolved in a litre
of water. Such a solution is known as <i>normal</i>. Thus a normal
solution of sodium carbonate contains 53 grammes per litre, of
sodium hydrate 40 grammes, of hydrochloric acid 36.5 grammes,
and so on. By taking 1/10th or 1/100th of these quantities, <i>decinormal</i>
or <i>centinormal</i> solutions are obtained. We see therefore that
1 cubic centimetre of a normal sodium carbonate solution will exactly
neutralize 0.049 gramme of sulphuric acid, 0.0365 gramme of
hydrochloric acid (i.e. the equivalent quantities), and similarly for
decinormal and centinormal solutions. Unfortunately, the term
normal is sometimes given to solutions which are strictly decinormal;
for example, iodine, sodium thiosulphate, &amp;c. In technical analysis,
where a solution is used for one process only, it may be prepared so
that 1 cc. is equal to .01 gramme of the substance to be estimated.
This saves a certain amount of arithmetic, but when the solution
is applied in another determination additional calculations are
necessary. Standard solutions are prepared by weighing out the
exact amount of the pure substance and dissolving it in water, or
by forming a solution of approximate normality, determining its
exact strength by gravimetric or other means, and then correcting
it for any divergence. This may be exemplified in the case of
alkalimetry. Pure sodium carbonate is prepared by igniting the
bicarbonate, and exactly 53 grammes are dissolved in water, forming
a strictly normal solution. An approximate normal sulphuric acid is
prepared from 30 ccs. of the pure acid (1.84 specific gravity) diluted
to 1 litre. The solutions are titrated (see below) and the acid solution
diluted until equal volumes are exactly equivalent. A standard
sodium hydrate solution can be prepared by dissolving 42 grammes
of sodium hydrate, making up to a litre, and diluting until one
cubic centimetre is exactly equivalent to one cubic centimetre of the
sulphuric acid. Similarly, normal solutions of hydrochloric and nitric
acids can be prepared. Where a solution is likely to change in
composition on keeping, such as potassium permanganate, iodine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
sodium hydrate, &amp;c., it is necessary to check or re-standardize it
periodically.</p>

<p>(2) The preparation of the solution of the substance consists in
dissolving an accurately determined weight, and making up the
volume in a graduated cylinder or flask to a known volume.</p>

<p>(3) The titration is conducted by running the standard solution
from a burette into a known volume of the test solution, which is
usually transferred from the stock-bottle to a beaker or basin by
means of a pipette. Various artifices are employed to denote the
end of the reaction. These may be divided into two groups:
(1) those in which a change in appearance of the reacting mixture occurs;
(2) those in which it is necessary to use an indicator which, by its
change in appearance, shows that an excess of one reagent is present.
In the first group, we have to notice the titration of a cyanide with
silver nitrate, when a milkiness shows how far the reaction has gone;
the titration of iron with permanganate, when the faint pink colour
shows that all the iron is oxidized. In the second group, we may
notice the application of litmus, methyl orange or phenolphthalein
in alkalimetry, when the acid or alkaline character of the solution
commands the colour which it exhibits; starch paste, which forms
a blue compound with free iodine in iodometry; potassium chromate,
which forms red silver chromate after all the hydrochloric acid is
precipitated in solutions of chlorides; and in the estimation of
ferric compounds by potassium bichromate, the indicator, potassium
ferricyanide, is placed in drops on a porcelain plate, and the end of
the reaction is shown by the absence of a blue coloration when
a drop of the test solution is brought into contact with it.</p>
</div>

<p>(&gamma;) <i>Electrolytic.</i>&mdash;This method consists in decomposing a
solution of a salt of the metal by the electric current and weighing
the metal deposited at the cathode.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is only by paying great attention to the current density that
good results are obtained, since metals other than that sought for may
be deposited. In acid copper solutions, mercury is deposited before
the copper with which it subsequently amalgamates; silver is
thrown down simultaneously; bismuth appears towards the end;
and after all the copper has been precipitated, arsenic and antimony
may be deposited. Lead and manganese are partially separated
as peroxides, but the remaining metals are not deposited from acid
solutions. It is therefore necessary that the solution should be free
from metals which may vitiate the results, or special precautions
taken by which the impurities are rendered harmless. In such cases
the simplicity of manipulation and the high degree of accuracy of
the method have made it especially valuable. The electrolysis is
generally conducted with platinum electrodes, of which the cathode
takes the form of a piece of foil bent into a cylindrical form, the
necessary current being generated by one or more Daniell cells.</p>
</div>

<p>(&delta;) <i>Colorimetric.</i>&mdash;This method is adopted when it is
necessary to determine minute traces (as in the liquid obtained in the
electrolytic separation of copper) of substances which afford
well-defined colour reactions.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The general procedure is to make a series of standard solutions
containing definite quantities of the substance which it is desired to
estimate; such a series will exhibit tints which deepen as the
quantity of the substance is increased. A known weight of the test
substance is dissolved and a portion of the solution is placed in a
tube similar to those containing the standard solutions. The
colour-producing reagent is added and the tints compared. In the case of
copper, the colour reactions with potassium ferrocyanide or ammonia
are usually employed; traces of ammonia are estimated with
<i>Nessler&rsquo;s reagent</i>; sulphur in iron and steel is determined by the
tint assumed by a silver-copper plate suspended in the gases liberated
when the metal is dissolved in sulphuric acid (Eggertz&rsquo;s test) (see
W. Crookes, <i>Select Methods in Analytical Chemistry</i>).</p>
</div>

<p class="center1"><i>Organic Analysis.</i></p>

<p>The elements which play important parts in organic compounds
are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, bromine, iodine,
sulphur, phosphorus and oxygen. We shall here consider the
qualitative and quantitative determination of these elements.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Qualitative.</i>&mdash;Carbon is detected by the formation of carbon
dioxide, which turns lime-water milky, and hydrogen by the formation
of water, which condenses on the tube, when the substance is
heated with copper oxide. Nitrogen may be detected by the
evolution of ammonia when the substance is heated with soda-lime.
A more delicate method is that due to J. L. Lassaigne and improved
by O. Jacobsen and C. Graebe. The substance is heated with
metallic sodium or potassium (in excess if sulphur be present) to
redness, the residue treated with water, filtered, and ferrous sulphate,
ferric chloride and hydrochloric acid added. A blue coloration
indicates nitrogen, and is due to the formation of potassium (or
sodium) cyanide during the fusion, and subsequent interaction
with the iron salts. The halogens may be sometimes detected by
fusing with lime, and testing the solution for a bromide, chloride
and iodide in the usual way. F. Beilstein determines their presence
by heating the substance with pure copper oxide on a platinum
wire in the Bunsen flame; a green coloration is observed if halogens
be present. Sulphur is detected by heating the substance with
sodium, dissolving the product in water, and adding sodium
nitroprusside; a bluish-violet coloration indicates sulphur (H. Vohl).
Or we may use J. Horbaczewski&rsquo;s method, which consists in boiling
the substance with strong potash, saturating the cold solution with
chlorine, adding hydrochloric acid, and boiling till no more chlorine is
liberated, and then testing for sulphuric acid with barium chloride.
Phosphorus is obtained as a soluble phosphate (which can be examined
in the usual way) by lixiviating the product obtained when
the substance is ignited with potassium nitrate and carbonate.</p>

<p><i>Quantitative.</i>&mdash;Carbon and hydrogen are generally estimated by
the <i>combustion</i> process, which consists in oxidizing the substance
and absorbing the products of combustion in suitable
<span class="sidenote">Carbon and hydrogen.</span>
apparatus. The oxidizing agent in commonest use is
copper oxide, which must be freshly ignited before use on
account of its hygroscopic nature. Lead chromate is sometimes
used, and many other substances, such as platinum, manganese
dioxide, &amp;c., have been suggested. The procedure for a combustion
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:620px; height:92px" src="images/img64a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:192px" src="images/img64b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">A hard glass tube slightly longer than the furnace and 12 to 15 mm.
in diameter is thoroughly cleansed and packed as shown in fig. 1.
The space a must allow for the inclusion of a copper spiral if the
substance contains nitrogen, and a silver spiral if halogens be
present, for otherwise nitrogen oxides and the halogens may be
condensed in the absorption apparatus; b contains copper oxide;
c is a space for the insertion of a porcelain or platinum boat containing
a weighed quantity of the substance; d is a copper spiral. The end
d is connected to an air or oxygen supply with an intermediate
drying apparatus. The other end is connected with the absorption
vessels, which consist of a tube (e) containing calcium chloride, and
a set of bulbs (f) containing potash solution. Various forms of potash
bulbs are employed; fig. 2 is Liebig&rsquo;s, fig. 3 Mohr&rsquo;s or Geissler&rsquo;s,
fig. 4 is a more recent form, of which special variations have been
made by Anderson, Gomberg, Delisle and others. After having
previously roasted the tube and copper oxide, and reduced the
copper spiral a, the weighed calcium chloride tube and potash bulbs
are put in position, the boat containing the substance is inserted
(in the case of a difficultly combustible substance it is desirable to
mix it with cupric oxide or lead chromate), the copper spiral (d)
replaced, and the air and oxygen supply connected up. The
apparatus is then tested for leaks. If all the connexions are sound,
the copper oxide is gradually heated from the end a, the gas-jets
under the spiral d are lighted, and a slow current of oxygen is passed
through the tube. The success of the operation depends upon the
slow burning of the substance. Towards the end the heat and the
oxygen supply are increased. When there is no more absorption
in the potash bulbs, the oxygen supply is cut off and air passed
through. Having replaced the oxygen in the absorption vessels by
air, they are disconnected and weighed, after having cooled down
to the temperature of the room. The increase in weight of the calcium
chloride tube gives the weight of water formed, and of the potash
bulbs the carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Liquids are amenable to the same treatment, but especial care
must be taken so that they volatilize slowly. Difficultly volatile
liquids may be weighed directly into the boat; volatile liquids are
weighed in thin hermetically sealed bulbs, the necks of which are
broken just before they are placed in the combustion tube.</p>

<p>The length of time and other disadvantages attending the combustion
method have caused investigators to devise other processes.
In 1855 C. Brunner described a method for oxidizing the carbon
to carbon dioxide, which could be estimated by the usual methods,
by heating the substance with potassium bichromate and sulphuric
acid. This process has been considerably developed by J. Messinger,
and we may hope that with subsequent improvements it may be
adapted to all classes of organic compounds. The oxidation, which
is effected by chromic acid and sulphuric acid, is conducted in a flask
provided with a funnel and escape tube, and the carbon dioxide
formed is swept by a current of dry air, previously freed from carbon
dioxide, through a drying tube to a set of potash bulbs and a tube
containing soda-lime; if halogens are present, a small wash bottle
containing potassium iodide, and a <b>U</b> tube containing glass wool
moistened with silver nitrate on one side and strong sulphuric acid
on the other, must be inserted between the flask and the drying tube.
The increase in weight of the potash bulbs and soda-lime tube gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
the weight of carbon dioxide evolved. C.F. Cross and E.J. Bevan
collected the carbon dioxide obtained in this way over mercury.
They also showed that carbon monoxide was given off towards the
end of the reaction, and oxygen was not evolved unless the temperature
exceeded 100°.</p>

<p>Methods depending upon oxidation in the presence of a contact
substance have come into favour during recent years. In that of
M. Dennstedt, which was first proposed in 1902, the substance is
vaporized in a tube containing at one end platinum foil, platinized
quartz, or platinized asbestos. The platinum is maintained at a
bright red heat, either by a gas flame or by an electric furnace, and
the vapour is passed over it by leading in a current of oxygen. If
nitrogen be present, a boat containing dry lead peroxide and heated
to 320° is inserted, the oxide decomposing any nitrogen peroxide
which may be formed. The same absorbent quantitatively takes
up any halogen and sulphur which may be present. The process is
therefore adapted to the simultaneous estimation of carbon, hydrogen,
the halogens and sulphur.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is estimated by (1) Dumas&rsquo; method, which consists in
heating the substance with copper oxide and measuring the volume
of nitrogen liberated; (2) by Will and Varrentrapp&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Sidenote: Nitrogen.</span>
method, in which the substance is heated with soda-lime,
and the ammonia evolved is absorbed in hydrochloric acid, and thence
precipitated as ammonium chlorplatinate or estimated volumetrically;
or (3) by Kjeldahl&rsquo;s method, in which the substance is dissolved
in concentrated sulphuric acid, potassium permanganate added, the
liquid diluted and boiled with caustic soda, and the evolved ammonia
absorbed in hydrochloric acid and estimated as in Will and
Varrentrapp&rsquo;s method.</p>

<p><i>Dumas&rsquo; Method.</i>&mdash;In this method the operation is carried out in a
hard glass tube sealed at one end and packed as shown in fig. 5.
The magnesite (a) serves for the generation of carbon dioxide which
clears the tube of air before the compound (mixed with fine copper
oxide (b)) is burned, and afterwards sweeps the liberated nitrogen
into the receiving vessel (e), which contains a strong potash solution;
c is coarse copper oxide; and d a reduced copper
gauze spiral, heated in order to decompose any
nitrogen oxides. Ulrich Kreusler generates the
carbon dioxide in a separate apparatus, and
in this case the tube is drawn out to a capillary
at the end (a). This artifice is specially valuable
when the substance decomposes or volatilizes
in a warm current of carbon dioxide. Various
forms of the absorbing apparatus (e) have been
discussed by M. Ilinski (<i>Ber.</i> 17, p. 1347), who
has also suggested the use of manganese carbonate
instead of magnesite, since the change
of colour enables one to follow the decomposition.
Substances which burn with difficulty may be mixed with
mercuric oxide in addition to copper oxide.</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:500px; height:384px" src="images/img65a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><i>Will and Varrentrapp&rsquo;s Method.</i>&mdash;This method, as originally
proposed, is not in common use, but has been superseded by Kjeldahl&rsquo;s
method, since the nitrogen generally comes out too low. It is
susceptible of wider application by mixing reducing agents with the
soda-lime: thus Goldberg (<i>Ber.</i> 16, p. 2546) uses a mixture of
soda-lime, stannous chloride and sulphur for nitro- and azo-compounds,
and C. Arnold (<i>Ber.</i> 18, p. 806) a mixture containing
sodium hyposulphite and sodium formate for nitrates.</p>

<p><i>Kjeldahl&rsquo;s Method.</i>&mdash;This method rapidly came into favour on
account of its simplicity, both of operation and apparatus. Various
substances other than potassium permanganate have been suggested
for facilitating the operation; J.W. Gunning (<i>Z. anal. Chem.</i>, 1889,
p. 189) uses potassium sulphate; Lassar-Cohn uses mercuric oxide.
The applicability of the process has been examined by F.W. Dafert
(<i>Z. anal. Chem.</i>, 1888, p. 224), who has divided nitrogenous bodies
into two classes with respect to it. The first class includes those
substances which require no preliminary treatment, and comprises
the amides and ammonium compounds, pyridines, quinolines,
alkaloids, albumens and related bodies; the second class requires
preliminary treatment and comprises, with few exceptions, the nitro-,
nitroso-, azo-, diazo- and amidoazo-compounds, hydrazines, derivatives
of nitric and nitrous acids, and probably cyanogen compounds.
Other improvements have been suggested by Dyer (<i>J.C.S. Trans.</i>
67, p. 811). For an experimental comparison of the accuracy of
the Dumas, Will-Varrentrapp and Kjeldahl processes see L. L&rsquo;Hôte,
<i>C.R.</i> 1889, p. 817. Debordeaux (<i>C.R.</i> 1904, p. 905) has obtained
good results by distilling the substance with a mixture of potassium
thiosulphate and sulphide.</p>

<p>The halogens may be estimated by ignition with quicklime, or by
heating with nitric acid and silver nitrate in a sealed tube. In the
first method the substance, mixed with quicklime free from chlorine,
is heated in a tube closed at one end in a combustion furnace.
<span class="sidenote">Halogens, sulphur, phosphorus.</span>
The product is dissolved in water, and the calcium
haloid estimated in the usual way. The same decomposition
may be effected by igniting with iron, ferric oxide and
sodium carbonate (E. Kopp, <i>Ber.</i> 10, p. 290); the operation
is easier if the lime be mixed with sodium carbonate, or a
mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium nitrate be used. With
iodine compounds, iodic acid is likely to be formed, and hence the
solution must be reduced with sulphurous acid before precipitation
with silver nitrate. C. Zulkowsky (<i>Ber.</i> 18, R. 648) burns the
substance in oxygen, conducts the gases over platinized sand, and
collects the products in suitable receivers. The oxidation with
nitric acid in sealed tubes at a temperature of 150° to 200° for aliphatic
compounds, and 250° to 260° for aromatic compounds, is in common
use, for both the sulphur and phosphorus can be estimated, the
former being oxidized to sulphuric acid and the latter to phosphoric
acid. This method was due to L. Carius (<i>Ann.</i> 136, p. 129).
R. Klason (<i>Ber.</i> 19, p. 1910) determines sulphur and the halogens by
oxidizing the substance in a current of oxygen and nitrous fumes,
conducting the vapours over platinum foil, and absorbing the vapours
in suitable receivers. Sulphur and phosphorus can sometimes be
estimated by Messinger&rsquo;s method, in which the oxidation is effected
by potassium permanganate and caustic alkali, or by potassium
bichromate and hydrochloric acid. A comparison of the various
methods for estimating sulphur has been given by O. Hammarsten
(<i>Zeit. physiolog. Chem.</i> 9, p. 273), and by Höland (<i>Chemiker Zeitung</i>,
1893, p. 991). H.H. Pringsheim (<i>Ber.</i> 38, p. 1434) has devised a
method in which the oxidation is effected by sodium peroxide; the
halogens, phosphorus and sulphur can be determined by one operation.</p>

<p class="center1 sc">VI. PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY</p>

<p>We have seen how chemistry may be regarded as having for
its province the investigation of the composition of matter,
and the changes in composition which matter or energy may
effect on matter, while physics is concerned with the general
properties of matter. A physicist, however, does more than
merely quantitatively determine specific properties of matter;
he endeavours to establish mathematical laws which co-ordinate
his observations, and in many cases the equations expressing such
laws contain functions or terms which pertain solely to the
chemical composition of matter. One example will suffice here.
The limiting law expressing the behaviour of gases under varying
temperature and pressure assumes the form pv = RT; so stated,
this law is independent of chemical composition and may be
regarded as a true physical law, just as much as the law of universal
gravitation is a true law of physics. But this relation is
not rigorously true; in fact, it does not accurately express the
behaviour of any gas. A more accurate expression (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Condensation
of Gases</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Molecule</a></span>) is (p + a/v²)(v - b) = RT, in
which a and b are quantities which depend on the composition
of the gas, and vary from one gas to another.</p>

<p>It may be surmised that the quantitative measures of most
physical properties will be found to be connected with the
chemical nature of substances. In the investigation of these
relations the physicist and chemist meet on common ground;
this union has been attended by fruitful and far-reaching results,
and the correlation of physical properties and chemical composition
is one of the most important ramifications of physical
chemistry. This branch receives treatment below. Of considerable
importance, also, are the properties of solids, liquids and
gases in solution. This subject has occupied a dominant position
in physico-chemical research since the investigations of van&rsquo;t
Hoff and Arrhenius. This subject is treated in the article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Solution</a></span>; for the properties of liquid mixtures reference should
also be made to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Distillation</a></span>.</p>

<p>Another branch of physical chemistry has for its purpose the
quantitative study of chemical action, a subject which has
brought out in clear detail the analogies of chemical and physical
equilibrium (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chemical Action</a></span>). Another branch, related
to energetics (<i>q.v.</i>), is concerned with the transformation of
chemical energy into other forms of energy&mdash;heat, light, electricity.
Combustion is a familiar example of the transformation
of chemical energy into heat and light; the quantitative measures
of heat evolution or absorption (heat of combustion or combination),
and the deductions therefrom, are treated in the article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Thermochemistry</a></span>. Photography (<i>q.v.</i>) is based on chemical
action induced by luminous rays; apart from this practical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
application there are many other cases in which actinic rays
occasion chemical actions; these are treated in the article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Photochemistry</a></span>. Transformations of electrical into chemical
energy are witnessed in the processes of electrolysis (<i>q.v.</i>; see
also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrochemistry</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Electrometallurgy</a></span>). The converse
is presented in the common electric cell.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Physical Properties and Composition.</i></p>

<p>For the complete determination of the chemical structure of
any compound, three sets of data are necessary: (1) the empirical
chemical composition of the molecule; (2) the constitution, i.e.
the manner in which the atoms are linked together; and (3) the
configuration of the molecule, <i>i.e.</i> the arrangement of the atoms
in space. Identity in composition, but difference in constitution,
is generally known as &ldquo;isomerism&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>), and compounds
satisfying this relation differ in many of their physical properties.
If, however, two compounds only differ with regard to the spatial
arrangement of the atoms, the physical properties may be (1)
for the most part identical, differences, however, being apparent
with regard to the action of the molecules on polarized light, as
is the case when the configuration is due to the presence of an
asymmetric atom (optical isomerism); or (2) both chemical
and physical properties may be different when the configuration
is determined by the disposition of the atoms or groups attached
to a pair of doubly-linked atoms, or to two members of a ring
system (geometrical isomerism or allo-isomerism). Three sets
of physical properties may therefore be looked for: (1) depending
on composition, (2) depending on constitution, and (3) depending
on configuration. The first set provides evidence as to the
molecular weight of a substance: these are termed &ldquo;colligative
properties.&rdquo; The second and third sets elucidate the actual
structure of the molecule: these are known as &ldquo;constitutional
properties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In any attempts to gain an insight into the relations between
the physical properties and chemical composition of substances,
the fact must never be ignored that a comparison can only be
made when the particular property under consideration is
determined under strictly comparable conditions, in other words,
when the molecular states of the substances experimented upon
are identical. This is readily illustrated by considering the
properties of gases&mdash;the simplest state of aggregation. According
to the law of Avogadro, equal volumes of different gases under
the same conditions of temperature and pressure contain equal
numbers of molecules; therefore, since the density depends upon
the number of molecules present in unit volume, it follows that
for a comparison of the densities of gases, the determinations
must be made under coincident conditions, or the observations
reduced or re-computed for coincident conditions. When this
is done, such densities are measures of the molecular weights
of the substances in question.</p>

<p><i>Volume Relations.</i><a name="FnAnchor_17b" id="FnAnchor_17b" href="#Footnote_17b"><span class="sp">17</span></a>&mdash;When dealing with colligative properties
of liquids it is equally necessary to ensure comparability of
conditions. In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Condensation of Gases</a></span> (see also
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Molecule</a></span>) it is shown that the characteristic equation of gases
and liquids is conveniently expressed in the form (p + a/v²)(v - b) = RT.
This equation, which is mathematically deducible from
the kinetic theory of gases, expresses the behaviour of gases,
the phenomena of the critical state, and the behaviour of liquids;
solids are not accounted for. If we denote the critical volume,
pressure and temperature by V<span class="su">k</span>, P<span class="su">k</span> and T<span class="su">k</span>, then it may be
shown, either by considering the characteristic equation as a
perfect cube in v or by using the relations that dp/dv = 0,
d²p/dv² = 0 at the critical point, that V<span class="su">k</span> = 3b, P<span class="su">k</span> = a/27b²,
T<span class="sp">k</span> = 8a/27b. Eliminating a and b between these relations, we
derive P<span class="su">k</span>V<span class="su">k</span>/T<span class="su">k</span> = (3/8)R, a relation which should hold between the
critical constants of any substance. Experiment, however,
showed that while the quotient on the left hand of this equation
was fairly constant for a great number of substances, yet its
value was not (3/8)R but (1/3.7)R; this means that the critical density
is, as a general rule, 3.7 times the theoretical density. Deviation
from this rule indicates molecular dissociation or association.
By actual observations it has been shown that ether, alcohol,
many esters of the normal alcohols and fatty acids, benzene,
and its halogen substitution products, have critical constants
agreeing with this originally empirical law, due to Sydney Young
and Thomas; acetic acid behaves abnormally, pointing to
associated molecules at the critical point.</p>

<p>The critical volume provides data which may be tested for additive
relations. Theoretically the critical volume is three times the
volume at absolute zero, <i>i.e.</i> the actual volume of the
<span class="sidenote">Volume at critical point and at absolute zero.</span>
molecules; this is obvious by considering the result of
making T zero in the characteristic equation. Experimentally
(by extrapolation from the &ldquo;law of the rectilinear
diameter&rdquo;) the critical volume is four times the volume
at absolute zero (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Condensation of Gases</a></span>). The
most direct manner in which to test any property for additive
relations is to determine the property for a number of elements, and
then investigate whether these values hold for the elements in
combination.  Want of data for the elements, however, restricts this
method to narrow limits, and hence an indirect method is necessary.
It is found that isomers have nearly the same critical volume, and
that equal differences in molecular content occasion equal differences
in critical volume. For example, the difference due to an
increment of CH<span class="su">2</span> is about 56.6, as is shown in the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>Since the critical volume of normal pentane C<span class="su">5</span>H<span class="su">12</span> is 307.2, we
have H<span class="su">2</span> = C<span class="su">5</span>H<span class="su">12</span> - 5CH<span class="su">2</span> = 307.2 - 5 &times; 56.6 = 24.2, and
C = CH<span class="su">2</span> - H<span class="su">2</span> = 32.4. The critical volume of oxygen can be deduced from
the data of the above table, and is found to be 29, whereas the experimental
value is 25.</p>

<p>The researches of H. Kopp, begun in 1842, on the molecular
volumes, <i>i.e.</i> the volume occupied by one gramme molecular weight
of a substance, of liquids measured at their boiling-point
<span class="sidenote">Volume at boiling-point.</span>
under atmospheric pressure, brought to light a series of
additive relations which, in the case of carbon compounds,
render it possible to predict, in some measure, the composition
of the substance. In practice it is generally more convenient
to determine the density, the molecular volume being then obtained
by dividing the molecular weight of the substance by the density.
By the indirect method Kopp derived the following atomic volumes:</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="90%" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tc1">C.</td> <td class="tc1">O.</td> <td class="tc1">H.</td> <td class="tc1">Cl.</td> <td class="tc1">Br.</td> <td class="tc1">I.</td> <td class="tc1">S.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc1">11</td> <td class="tc1">12.2</td> <td class="tc1">5.5</td> <td class="tc1">22.8</td> <td class="tc1">27.8</td> <td class="tc1">37.5</td> <td class="tc1">22.6.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These values hold fairly well when compared with the experimental
values determined from other compounds, and also with the
molecular volumes of the elements themselves. Thus the actually
observed densities of liquid chlorine and bromine at the boiling-points
are 1.56 and 2.96, leading to atomic volumes 22.7 and 26.9,
which closely correspond to Kopp&rsquo;s values deduced from organic
compounds.</p>

<p>These values, however, require modification in certain cases, for
discrepancies occur which can be reconciled in some cases by assuming
that the atomic value of a polyvalent element varies according to the
distribution of its valencies. Thus a double bond of oxygen, as in the
carbonyl group CO, requires a larger volume than a single bond, as
in the hydroxyl group -OH, being about 12.2 in the first case and
7.8 in the second. Similarly, an increase of volume is associated
with doubly and trebly linked carbon atoms.</p>

<p>Recent researches have shown that the law originally proposed by
Kopp&mdash;&ldquo;That the specific volume of a liquid compound (molecular
volume) at its boiling-point is equal to the sum of the specific volumes
of its constituents (atomic volumes), and that every element has a
definite atomic value in its compounds&rdquo;&mdash;is by no means exact,
for isomers have different specific volumes, and the volume for an
increment of CH<span class="su">2</span> in different homologous series is by no means
constant; for example, the difference among the esters of the fatty
acids is about 57, whereas for the aliphatic aldehydes it is 49. We
may therefore conclude that the molecular volume depends more
upon the internal structure of the molecule than its empirical content.
W. Ostwald (<i>Lehr. der allg. Chem.</i>), after an exhaustive review of the
material at hand, concluded that simple additive relations did
exist but with considerable deviations, which he ascribed to
differences in structure. In this connexion we may notice W. Städel&rsquo;s
determinations:</p>

<p class="noind">These differences do not disappear at the critical point, and hence
the critical volumes are not strictly additive.</p>

<p>Theoretical considerations as to how far Kopp was justified in
choosing the boiling-points under atmospheric pressure as being
comparable states for different substances now claim our attention.
Van der Waal&rsquo;s equation (p+a/v²)(v-b) = RT contains two constants
a and b determined by each particular substance. If we express
the pressure, volume and temperature as fractions of the critical
constants, then, calling these fractions the &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; pressure,
volume and temperature, and denoting them by &pi;, &phi; and &theta;
respectively, the characteristic equation becomes
(&pi;+3/&phi;²)(3&phi;-1) = 8&theta;;
which has the same form for all substances. Obviously, therefore,
liquids are comparable when the pressures, volumes and temperatures
are equal fractions of the critical constants. In view
of the extremely slight compressibility of liquids, atmospheric
pressure may be regarded as a coincident condition; also C.M.
Guldberg pointed out that for the most diverse substances the
absolute boiling-point is about two-thirds of the critical temperature.
Hence within narrow limits Kopp&rsquo;s determinations were carried out
under coincident conditions, and therefore any regularities presented
by the critical volumes should be revealed in the specific volumes
at the boiling-point.</p>

<p>The connexion between the density and chemical composition of
solids has not been investigated with the same completeness as in the
case of gases and liquids. The relation between the atomic
<span class="sidenote">Volume relations of solids.</span>
volumes and the atomic weights of the solid elements
exhibits the periodicity which generally characterizes the
elements. The molecular volume is additive in certain
cases, in particular of analogous compounds of simple constitution.
For instance, constant differences are found between the chlorides,
bromides and iodides of sodium and potassium:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Thermal Relations.</i></p>

<p><i>Specific Heat and Composition.</i>&mdash;-The nature and
experimental determination of specific heats are discussed in the
article CALORIMETRY; here will be discussed the relations existing
between the heat capacities of elements and compounds.</p>

<p>In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Thermodynamics</a></span> it is shown that the amount
of heat required to raise a given weight of a gas through a certain
range of temperature is different according as the gas
<span class="sidenote">Specific heat of gases.</span>
is maintained at constant pressure, the volume increasing,
or at constant volume, the pressure increasing.
A gas, therefore, has two specific heats, generally
denoted by C<span class="su">p</span> and C<span class="su">v</span>, when the quantity of gas taken as a unit
is one gramme molecular weight, the range of temperature being
1° C. It may be shown that C<span class="su">p</span> - C<span class="su">v</span> = R, where R is the
gas-constant, <i>i.e.</i> R in the equation PV = RT. From the ratio
C<span class="su">p</span>/C<span class="su">v</span> conclusions may be drawn as to the molecular condition
of the gas. By considerations based on the kinetic theory of gases
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Molecule</a></span>) it may be shown that when no energy is utilized
in separating the atoms of a molecule, this ratio is 5/3 = 1.67.
If, however, an amount of energy a is taken up in separating
atoms, the ratio is expressible as C<span class="su">p</span>/C<span class="su">v</span> = (5+a)/(3+a), which
is obviously smaller than 5/3, and decreases with increasing
values of a. These relations may be readily tested, for the ratio
C<span class="su">p</span>/C<span class="su">v</span> is capable of easy experimental determination. It is found
that mercury vapour, helium, argon and its associates (neon,
krypton, &amp;c.) have the value 1.67; hence we conclude that these
gases exist as monatomic molecules. Oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen
and carbon monoxide have the value 1.4; these gases have
diatomic molecules, a fact capable of demonstration by other
means. Hence it may be inferred that this value is typical for
diatomic molecules. Similarly, greater atomic complexity is
reflected in a further decrease in the ratio C<span class="su">p</span>/C<span class="su">v</span>. The following
table gives a comparative view of the specific heats and the
ratio for molecules of variable atomic content.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The abnormal specific heats of the halogen elements may be due
to a loosening of the atoms, a preliminary to the dissociation into
monatomic molecules which occurs at high temperatures. In the
more complex gases the specific heat varies considerably with
temperature; only in the case of monatomic gases does it remain
constant. Le Chatelier (<i>Zeit. f. phys. Chem.</i> i. 456) has given the
formula C<span class="su">p</span> = 6.5 + aT, where a is a constant depending on the
complexity of the molecule, as an expression for the molecular heat
at constant pressure at any temperature T (reckoned on the absolute

<p><i>Specific Heats of Solids.</i>&mdash;The development of the atomic
theory and the subsequent determination of atomic weights
in the opening decades of the 19th century inspired A.T. Petit
and P.L. Dulong to investigate relations (if any) existing
between specific heats and the atomic weight. Their observations
on the solid elements led to a remarkable generalization,
now known as Dulong and Petit&rsquo;s law. This states that &ldquo;the
atomic heat (the product of the atomic weight and specific
heat) of all elements is a constant quantity.&rdquo; The value
of this constant when H = 1 is about 6.4; Dulong and Petit,
using O = 1, gave the value .38, the specific heat of water being
unity in both cases. This law&mdash;purely empirical in origin&mdash;was
strengthened by Berzelius, who redetermined many specific
heats, and applied the law to determine the true atomic weight
from the equivalent weight. At the same time he perceived
that specific heats varied with temperature and also with
allotropes, <i>e.g.</i> graphite and diamond. The results of Berzelius were
greatly extended by Hermann Kopp, who recognized that carbon,
boron and silicon were exceptions to the law. He regarded these
anomalies as solely due to the chemical nature of the elements,
and ignored or regarded as insignificant such factors as the state
of aggregation and change of specific heat with temperature.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The specific heats of carbon, boron and silicon subsequently
formed the subject of elaborate investigations by H.F. Weber, who
showed that with rise of temperature the specific (and atomic) heat
increases, finally attaining a fairly constant value; diamond,
graphite and the various amorphous forms of carbon having the value
about 5.6 at 1000°, and silicon 5.68 at 232°; while he concluded
that boron attained a constant value of 5.5. Niison and Pettersson&rsquo;s
observations on beryllium and germanium have shown that the
atomic heats of these metals increase with rise of temperature,
finally becoming constant with a value 5.6. W.A. Tilden (<i>Phil.
Trans.</i>, 1900, p. 233) investigated nickel and cobalt over a wide
range of temperature (from -182.5° to 100°); his results are:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">It is evident that the atomic heats of these intimately associated
elements approach nearer and nearer as we descend in temperature,
approximating to the value 4. Other metals were tested in order
to determine if their atomic heats approximated to this value at low
temperatures, but with negative results.</p>

<p>It is apparent that the law of Dulong and Petit is not rigorously
true, and that deviations are observed which invalidate the law as
originally framed. Since the atomic heat of the same element
varies with its state of aggregation, it must be concluded that some
factor taking this into account must be introduced; moreover, the
variation of specific heat with temperature introduces another factor.</p>
</div>

<p>We now proceed to discuss molecular heats of compounds,
that is, the product of the molecular weight into the specific
heat. The earliest generalization in this direction is associated
with F.E. Neumann, who, in 1831, deduced from observations
on many carbonates (calcium, magnesium, ferrous, zinc, barium
and lead) that stoichiometric quantities (equimolecular weights)
of compounds possess the same heat capacity. This is spoken of
as &ldquo;Neumann&rsquo;s law.&rdquo; Regnault confirmed Neumann&rsquo;s observations,
and showed that the molecular heat depended on the
number of atoms present, equiatomic compounds having the
same molecular heat. Kopp systematized the earlier observations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
and, having made many others, he was able to show that
the molecular heat was an additive property, <i>i.e.</i> each element
retains the same heat capacity when in combination as in the
free state. This has received confirmation by the researches
of W.A. Tilden (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1904, 203 A, p.139) for those
elements whose atomic heats vary considerably with temperature.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The specific heat of a compound may, in general, be calculated
from the specific heats of its constituent elements. Conversely, if
the specific heats of a compound and its constituent elements,
except one, be known, then the unknown atomic heat is readily
deducible. Similarly, by taking the difference of the molecular heats
of compounds differing by one constituent, the molecular (or atomic)
heat of this constituent is directly obtained. By this method it is
shown that water, when present as &ldquo;water of crystallization,&rdquo;
behaves as if it were ice.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Deductions from Dulong and Petit&rsquo;s Law.</i>&mdash;Denoting the
atomic weight by W and the specific heat by s, Dulong and
Petit&rsquo;s law states that 6.4 = Ws. Thus if s be known, an approximate
value of W is determinate. In the determination of the
atomic weight of an element two factors must be considered:
(1) its equivalent weight, <i>i.e.</i> the amount which is equivalent to
one part of hydrogen; and (2) a factor which denotes the number
of atoms of hydrogen which combines with or is equivalent to
one atom of the particular element. This factor is termed the
valency. The equivalent weight is capable of fairly ready
determination, but the settlement of the second factor is somewhat
more complex, and in this direction the law of atomic heats
is of service. To take an example: 38 parts of indium combine
with 35.4 parts of chlorine; hence, if the formula of the chloride
be InCl, InCl<span class="su">2</span> or InCl<span class="su">3</span>, indium has the atomic weights 38, 76
or 114. The specific heat of indium is 0.057; and the atomic
heats corresponding to the atomic weights 38, 76 and 114 are
3.2, 4.3, 6.5. Dulong and Petit&rsquo;s law thus points to the value
114, which is also supported by the position occupied by this
element in the periodic classification. C. Winkler decided the
atomic weight of germanium by similar reasoning.</p>

<p><i>Boiling-Point and Composition.</i>&mdash;From the relation between
the critical constants P<span class="su">k</span>V<span class="su">k</span>/T<span class="su">k</span> = (1/3.7)R or T<span class="su">k</span>/P<span class="su">k</span> = 3.7V<span class="su">k</span>/R, and
since V<span class="su">k</span> is proportional to the volume at absolute zero, the ratio
T<span class="su">k</span>/P<span class="su">k</span> should exhibit additive relations. This ratio, termed by
Guye the critical coefficient, has the following approximate
values:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="width: 90%;" summary="Contents">

<p>Since at the boiling-point under atmospheric pressure liquids
are in corresponding states, the additive nature of the critical
coefficient should also be presented by boiling-points. It may
be shown theoretically that the absolute boiling-point is
proportional to the molecular volume, and, since this property is
additive, the boiling-point should also be additive.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>These relations have been more thoroughly tested in the case of
organic compounds, and the results obtained agree in some measure
with the deductions from molecular volumes. In general, isomers
boil at about the same temperature, as is shown by the isomeric
esters C<span class="su">9</span>H<span class="su">18</span>O<span class="su">2</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Equal increments in the molecule are associated with an equal
rise in the boiling-point, but this increment varies in different
homologous series. Thus in the normal fatty alcohols, acids, esters,
nitriles and ketones, the increment per CH<span class="su">2</span> is 19°-21°; in the
aldehydes it is 26°-27°. In the aromatic compounds there is no
regularity between the increments due to the introduction of methyl
groups into the benzene nucleus or side chains; the normal value
of 20°-21° is exhibited, however, by pyridine and its derivatives.
The substitution of a hydrogen atom by the hydroxyl group generally
occasions a rise in boiling-point at about 100°. The same increase
accompanies the introduction of the amino group into aromatic nuclei.</p>

<p>While certain additive relations hold between some homologous
series, yet differences occur which must be referred to the
constitution of the molecule. As a general rule, compounds formed
<span class="sidenote">Constitutive influences.</span>
with a great evolution of heat have high boiling-points,
and vice versa. The introduction of negative groups into
a molecule alters the boiling-point according to the number
of negative groups already present. This is shown in the case of the
chloracetic acids:</p>

<p>The replacement of one negative group by another is accompanied by
a change in the boiling-point, which is independent of the compound
in which the substitution is effected, and solely conditioned by the
nature of the replaced and replacing groups. Thus bromine and iodine
replace chlorine with increments of about 22° and 50° respectively.</p>

<p>A factor of considerable importance in determining boiling-points
of isomers is the symmetry of the molecule. Referring to the esters
C<span class="su">9</span>H<span class="su">18</span>O<span class="su">2</span> previously mentioned, it is seen that the highest
boiling-points belong to methyl octoate and octyl formate, the least
symmetrical, while the minimum belongs to amyl butyrate, the most
symmetrical. The isomeric pentanes also exhibit a similar relation
CH<span class="su">3</span>(CH<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">4</span>CH<span class="su">3</span> = 38°, (CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>CHC<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">5</span> = 30°,
(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span>C = 9.5°. For a
similar reason secondary alcohols boil at a lower temperature than
the corresponding primary, the difference being about 19°. A.E.
Earp (<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, 1893 [5], 35, p. 458) has shown that, while an
increase in molecular weight is generally associated with a rise in
the boiling-point, yet the symmetry of the resulting molecule may
exert such a lowering effect that the final result is a diminution in the
boiling-point. The series H<span class="su">2</span>S = -61°, CH<span class="su">3</span>SH = 21°, (CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>S = 41°
is an example; in the first case, the molecular weight is increased
and the symmetry diminished, the increase of boiling-point
being 82°; in the second case the molecular weight is again increased
but the molecule assumes a more symmetrical configuration, hence
the comparatively slight increase of 20°. A similar depression is
presented by methyl alcohol (67°) and methyl ether (-23°).</p>

<p>Among the aromatic di-substitution derivatives the <i>ortho</i> compounds
have the highest boiling-point, and the <i>meta</i> boil at a higher,
or about the same temperature as the <i>para</i> compounds. Of the
tri-derivatives the symmetrical compounds boil at the lowest
temperature, the asymmetric next, and the vicinal at the highest.</p>

<p>An ethylenic or double carbon union in the aliphatic hydrocarbons
has, apparently, the same effect on the boiling-point as two hydrogen
atoms, since the compounds C<span class="su">n</span>H<span class="su">2n+2</span> and C<span class="su">n</span>H<span class="su">2n</span> boil at about
the same temperature. An acetylenic or triple linkage is associated
with a rise in the boiling-point; for example, propargyl compounds
boil about 19.5° higher than the corresponding propyl compound.</p>

<p>Certain regularities attend the corresponding property of the
melting-point. A rule applicable to organic compounds, due to
Adolf v. Baeyer and supported by F.S. Kipping (<i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>,
1893, 63, p.465) states, that the melting-point of any odd member
of a homologous series is lower than the melting-point of the even
member containing one carbon atom less. This is true of the fatty
acid series, and the corresponding ketones and alcohols, and also of
the succinic acid series. Other regularities exist, but generally with
many exceptions. It is to be noted that although the correlation of
melting-point with constitution has not been developed to such
an extent as the chemical significance of other physical properties,
the melting-point is the most valuable test of the purity of a
substance, a circumstance due in considerable measure to the fact that
impurities always tend to lower the melting-point.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Heat of Combustion and Constitution.</i>&mdash;In the article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Thermochemistry</a></span> a general account of heats of formation of chemical
compounds is given, and it is there shown that this constant
measures the stability of the compound. In organic chemistry
it is more customary to deal with the &ldquo;heat of combustion,&rdquo;
i.e. the heat evolved when an organic compound is completely
burned in oxygen; the heat of formation is deduced from the
fact that it is equal to the heats of formation of the products
of combustion less the observed heat of combustion. The
researches of Julius Thomsen and others have shown that in many
cases definite conclusions regarding constitution can be drawn
from quantitative measurements of the heats of combustion;
and in this article a summary of the chief results will be given.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The identity of the four valencies of the carbon atom follows
from the fact that the heats of combustion of methane, ethane,
propane, trimethyl methane, and tetramethyl methane, have a
constant difference in the order given, viz. 158.6 calories; this means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
that the replacement of a hydrogen atom by a methyl group is
attended by a constant increase in the heat of combustion. The
same difference attends the introduction of the methyl group into
many classes of compounds, for example, the paraffins, olefines,
acetylenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones
and esters, while a slightly lower value (157.1) is found in the case
of the halogen compounds, nitriles, amines, acids, ethers, sulphides
and nitro compounds. It therefore appears that the difference between
the heats of combustion of two adjacent members of a series
of homologous compounds is practically a constant, and that this
constant has two average values, viz. 158.6 and 157.1.</p>

<p>An important connexion between heats of combustion and
constitution is found in the investigation of the effect of single,
double and triple carbon linkages on the thermochemical constants.
If twelve grammes of amorphous carbon be burnt to carbon dioxide
under constant volume, the heat evolved (96.96 cal.) does not measure
the entire thermal effect, but the difference between this and the
heat required to break down the carbon molecule into atoms.
If the number of atoms in the carbon molecule be denoted by n,
and the heat required to split off each atom from the molecule by d,
then the total heat required to break down a carbon molecule
completely into atoms is nd. It follows that the true heat of combustion
of carbon, <i>i.e.</i> the heat of combustion of one gramme-atom,
is 96.96 + d. The value of d can be evaluated by considering the
combustion of amorphous carbon to carbon monoxide and carbon
dioxide. In the first case the thermal effect of 58.58 calories actually
observed must be increased by 2d to allow for the heat absorbed in
splitting off two gramme-atoms of carbon; in the second case the
thermal effect of 96.96 must be increased by d as above. Now in
both cases one gramme-molecule of oxygen is decomposed, and the
two oxygen atoms thus formed are combined with two carbon
valencies. It follows that the thermal effects stated above must be
equal, <i>i.e.</i> 58.58 + 2d = 96.96 + d, and therefore d = 38.38. The absolute
heat of combustion of a carbon <i>atom</i> is therefore 135.34 calories,
and this is independent of the form of the carbon burned.</p>

<p>Consider now the combustion of a hydrocarbon of the general
formula C<span class="su">n</span>H<span class="su">2m</span>. We assume that each carbon atom and each
hydrogen atom contributes equally to the thermal effect. If &alpha; be
the heat evolved by each carbon atom, and &beta; that by each hydrogen
atom, the thermal effect may be expressed as H = n&alpha; + 2m&beta; - A,
where A is the heat required to break the molecule into its constituent
atoms. If the hydrocarbon be saturated, <i>i.e.</i> only contain single
carbon linkages, then the number of such linkages is 2n - m, and if
the thermal effect of such a linkage be X, then the term A is obviously
equal to (2n - m)X. The value of H then becomes
H = n&alpha; + 2m&beta; - (2n - m)X or n&xi; + m&nu;,
where &xi; and &nu; are constants. Let double
bonds be present, in number p, and let the energy due to such a
bond be Y. Then the number of single bonds is 2n - m - 2p, and the
heat of combustion becomes H<span class="su">1</span> = n&xi; + m&nu; + p(2X - Y). If triple bonds,
q in number, occur also, and the energy of such a bond be Z, the
equation for H becomes</p>

<p class="center1">H = n&xi; + m&nu; + p(2X - Y) + q(3X - Z).</p>

<p>This is the general equation for calculating the heat of combustion
of a hydrocarbon. It contains four independent constants; two
of these may be calculated from the heats of combustion of
saturated hydrocarbons, and the other two from the combustion of
hydrocarbons containing double and triple linkages. By experiment
it is found that the thermal effect of a double bond is much less than
the effect of two single bonds, while a triple bond has a much smaller
effect than three single bonds. J. Thomsen deduces the actual
values of X, Y, Z to be 14.71, 13.27 and <i>zero</i>; the last value he
considers to be in agreement with the labile equilibrium of acetylenic
compounds. One of the most important applications of these values
is found in the case of the constitution of benzene, where Thomsen
decides in favour of the Claus formula, involving nine single carbon
linkages, and rejects the Kekulé formula, which has three single
and three double bonds (see section IV.).</p>

<p>The thermal effects of the common organic substituents have
also been investigated. The thermal effect of the &ldquo;alcohol&rdquo; group
C·OH may be determined by finding the heat of formation of the
alcohol and subtracting the thermal effects of the remaining linkages
in the molecule. The average value for primary alcohols is 44.67 cal.,
but many large differences from this value obtain in certain cases.
The thermal effects increase as one passes from primary to tertiary
alcohols, the values deduced from propyl and isopropyl alcohols and
trimethyl carbinol being:&mdash;primary = 45.08, secondary = 50.39,
tertiary = 60.98. The thermal effect of the aldehyde group has the
average value 64.88 calories, <i>i.e.</i> considerably greater than the alcohol
group. The ketone group corresponds to a thermal effect of 53.52
calories. It is remarkable that the difference in the heats of formation
of ketones and the paraffin containing one carbon atom less is
67.94 calories, which is the heat of formation of carbon monoxide
at constant volume. It follows therefore that two hydrocarbon
radicals are bound to the carbon monoxide residue with the same
strength as they combine to form a paraffin. The average value for
the carboxyl group is 119.75 calories, <i>i.e.</i> it is equal to the sum of
the thermal effects of the aldehyde and carbonyl groups.</p>

<p>The thermal effects of the halogens are: chlorine = l5.13 calories,
bromine = 7.68; iodine = -4.25 calories. It is remarkable that the
position of the halogen in the molecule has no effect on the heat of
formation; for example, chlorpropylene and allylchloride, and also
ethylene dichloride and ethylidene dichloride, have equal heats of
formation. The thermal effect of the ether group has an average
value of 34.31 calories. This value does not hold in the case of
methylene oxide if we assign to it the formula H<span class="su">2</span>C·<span style="border-top: 1px solid black;">O·CH</span><span class="su">2</span>, but
if the formula H<span class="su">2</span>C·O·CH<span class="su">2</span> (which assumes the presence of two free
valencies) be accepted, the calculated and observed heats of formation
are in agreement.</p>

<p>The combination of nitrogen with carbon may result in the
formation of nitriles, cyanides, or primary, secondary or tertiary
amines. Thomsen deduced that a single bond between a carbon and
a nitrogen gramme-atom corresponds to a thermal effect of 2.77
calories, a double bond to 5.44, and a treble bond to 8.31. From
this he infers that cyanogen is C:N·N:C and not N&#8758;C-C&#8758;N, that
hydrocyanic acid is HC·N, and acetonitrile CH<span class="su">3</span>·C&#8758;N. In the case
of the amines he decides in favour of the formulae</p>

<p><i>Refraction and Composition.</i>&mdash;Reference should be made to
the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Refraction</a></span> for the general discussion of the phenomenon
known as the refraction of light. It is there shown that
every substance, transparent to light, has a definite refractive
index, which is the ratio of the velocity of light <i>in vacuo</i> to its
velocity in the medium to which the refractive index refers.
The refractive index of any substance varies with (1) the wave-length
of the light; (2) with temperature; and (3) with the state
of aggregation. The first cause of variation may be at present
ignored; its significance will become apparent when we consider
dispersion (<i>vide infra</i>).The second and third causes, however,
are of greater importance, since they are associated with the
molecular condition of the substance; hence, it is obvious that
it is only from some function of the refractive index which is
independent of temperature variations and changes of state
(i.e. it must remain constant for the same substance at any
temperature and in any form) that quantitative relations between
refractivity and chemical composition can be derived.</p>

<p>The pioneer work in this field, now frequently denominated
&ldquo;spectro-chemistry,&rdquo; was done by Sir Isaac Newton, who, from
theoretical considerations based on his corpuscular theory of light,
determined the function (n²-1), where n is the refractive index,
to be the expression for the refractive power; dividing this
expression by the density (d), he obtained (n²-1)/d, which he
named the &ldquo;absolute refractive power.&rdquo; To P.S. Laplace is
due the theoretical proof that this function is independent of
temperature and pressure, and apparent experimental confirmation
was provided by Biot and Arago&rsquo;s, and by Dulong&rsquo;s observations
on gases and vapours. The theoretical basis upon which
this formula was devised (the corpuscular theory) was shattered
early in the 19th century, and in its place there arose the modern
wave theory which theoretically invalidates Newton&rsquo;s formula.
The question of the dependence of refractive index on temperature
was investigated in 1858 by J.H. Gladstone and the Rev.
T.P. Dale; the more simple formula (n-1)/d, which remained
constant for gases and vapours, but exhibited slight discrepancies
when liquids were examined over a wide range of temperature,
being adopted. The subject was next taken up by Hans Landolt,
who, from an immense number of observations, supported in
a general way the formula of Gladstone and Dale. He introduced
the idea of comparing the refractivity of equimolecular quantities
of different substances by multiplying the function (n-1)/d
by the molecular weight (M) of the substance, and investigated
the relations of chemical grouping to refractivity. Although
establishing certain general relations between atomic and
molecular refractions, the results were somewhat vitiated by the
inadequacy of the empirical function which he employed, since it
was by no means a constant which depended only on the actual
composition of the substance and was independent of its physical
condition. A more accurate expression (n²-1)/(n²+2)d was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
suggested in 1880 independently and almost simultaneously by
L.V. Lorenz of Copenhagen and H.A. Lorentz of Leiden, from
considerations based on the Clausius-Mossotti theory of dielectrics.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Assuming that the molecules are spherical, R.J.E. Clausius and
O.F. Mossotti found a relation between the dielectric constant and
the space actually occupied by the molecules, viz. K = (1 + 2a)/(1 - a),
or a = (K - 1)/(K + 2), where K is the dielectric constant and a the
fraction of the total volume actually occupied by matter. According
to the electromagnetic theory of light K = <span class="correction" title="amended from N_2">N²</span>, where N is the
refractive index for rays of infinite wave-length. Making this
substitution, and dividing by d, the density of the substance, we
obtain a/d = (N² - 1)/(N² + 2 )d. Since a/d is the real specific volume
of the molecule, it is therefore a constant; hence (N² - 1)/(N² + 2)d
is also a constant and is independent of all changes of temperature,
pressure, and of the state of aggregation. To determine N
recourse must be made to Cauchy&rsquo;s formula of dispersion (<i>q.v.</i>),
n = A + B/&lambda;<span class="sp">2</span> + C/&lambda;<span class="sp">4</span> + ... from which, by extrapolation, &lambda; becoming
infinite, we obtain N = A. In the case of substances possessing
anomalous dispersion, the direct measurement of the refractive
index for Hertzian waves of very long wave-length may be
employed.</p>

<p>It is found experimentally that the Lorenz and Lorentz
function holds fairly well, and better than the Gladstone and Dale
formula. This is shown by the following observations of Rühlmann

<p class="noind">Additive relations undoubtedly exist, but many discrepancies occur
which may be assigned, as in the case of molecular volumes, to
differences in constitution. Atomic refractions may be obtained
either directly, by investigating the various elements, or indirectly,
by considering differences in the molecular refractions of related
compounds. The first method needs no explanation. The second
method proceeds on the same lines as adopted for atomic volumes.
By subtracting the value for CH<span class="su">2</span>, which may be derived from two
substances belonging to the same homologous series, from the molecular
refraction of methane, CH<span class="su">4</span>, the value of hydrogen is obtained;
subtracting this from CH<span class="su">2</span>, the value of carbon is determined.
Hydroxylic oxygen is obtained by subtracting the molecular refractions
of acetic acid and acetaldehyde. Similarly, by this method of
differences, the atomic refraction of any element may be determined.
It is found, however, that the same element has not always the same
atomic refraction, the difference being due to the nature of the
elements which saturate its valencies. Thus oxygen varies according
as whether it is linked to hydrogen (hydroxylic oxygen), to two
atoms of carbon (ether oxygen), or to one carbon atom (carbonyl
oxygen); similarly, carbon varies according as whether it is singly,
doubly, or trebly bound to carbon atoms.</p>

<p><i>Dispersion and Composition.</i>&mdash;-In the preceding section we have
seen that substances possess a definite molecular (or atomic) refraction
for light of particular wave-length; the difference between the
refractions for any two rays is known as the molecular (or atomic)
dispersion. Since molecular refractions are independent of temperature
and of the state of aggregation, it follows that molecular dispersions
must be also independent of these conditions; and hence
quantitative measurements should give an indication as to the
chemical composition of substances. This subject has been principally
investigated by Brühl; he found that molecular dispersions
of liquids and gases were independent of temperature, and fairly
independent of the state of aggregation, but that no simple connexion
exists between atomic refractions and dispersions (see preceding
table). He also showed how changes in constitution effected dispersions
to a far greater extent than they did refractions; thus,
while the atomic dispersion of carbon is 0.039, the dispersions due
to a double and treble linkage is 0.23 and 0.19 respectively.</p>

<p><i>Colour and Constitution.</i>&mdash;In this article a summary of the
theories which have been promoted in order to connect the colour
of organic compounds with their constitution
will be given, and the reader is referred to the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Colour</a></span> for the physical explanation of
this property, and to <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vision</a></span> for the physiological
and psychological bearings. A clear distinction
must be drawn between colour and the property
of dyeing; all coloured substances are not dyes,
and it is shown in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dyeing</a></span> that the property of
entering into chemical or physical combination with fibres involves
properties other than those essential to colour. At the same
time, however, all dyestuffs are coloured substances.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A survey of coloured substances led O.N. Witt in 1876 to formulate
his &ldquo;chromophore-auxochrome&rdquo; theory. On this theory colour is
regarded as due to the presence of a &ldquo;chromophore,&rdquo; and dyeing
power to an &ldquo;auxochrome&rdquo;; the latter by itself
cannot produce colour or dyeing power, but it is
only active in the presence of a chromophore, when
it intensifies the colour and confers the property
of dyeing. The principal chromophores are the azo, -N=N-,
azoxy, =N<span class="su">2</span>O, nitro, -NO<span class="su">2</span>, nitroso, -NO,
and carbonyl, =CO, groups. The azo-group
is particularly active, both the aliphatic and
aromatic compounds being coloured. The simplest
aliphatic compounds, such as diazo-methane, diazo-ethane,
and azo-formic acid, are yellow; the
diamide of the latter acid is orange-red. Of the
aromatic compounds azo-benzene is bright orange-red, and &alpha;-azo-naphthalene
forms red needles or small steel-blue prisms. The azo-group,
however, has little or no colouring effect when present in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
ring system, such as in cinnolene, phthalazine and tolazone. The
nitro group has a very important action mainly on account of the
readiness with which it can be introduced into the molecule, but its
effect is much less than that of the azo group. The colour produced
is generally yellow, which, in accordance with a general rule, is
intensified with an increase in the number of groups; compare, for
example, mono-, di-and tri-nitrobenzene. The nitroso group is
less important. The colour produced is generally of a greenish
shade; for example, nitrosobenzene is green when fused or in solution
(when crystalline, it is colourless), and dinitrosoresorcin has been
employed as a dyestuff under the names &ldquo;solid green&rdquo; and
&ldquo;chlorine.&rdquo; The carbonyl group by itself does not produce colour,
but when two adjacent groups occur in the molecule, as for example
in the a-diketones (such as di-acetyl and benzil), a yellow colour is
produced. It also acts as a chromogenic centre when double bonds
or ethylenic linkages are present, as in fluorene ketone or fluorenone.</p>

<p>A more complex chromophoric group is the triple ethylenic grouping
<img style="width:74px; height:25px" src="images/img71a.jpg" alt="" />
the introduction of which was rendered necessary
by the discovery of certain coloured hydrocarbons. As a general
rule, hydrocarbons are colourless; the exceptions include the golden
yellow acenaphthylene, the red bidiphenylene-ethylene, and the
derivatives of fulvene
<img style="width:84px; height:25px" src="images/img71b.jpg" alt="" />
which have been discussed by J. Thiele (<i>Ber.</i>, 1900, 33, p. 666).
This grouping is not always colour-producing, since diphenyl is colourless.</p>

<p>The most important auxochromes are the hydroxyl (-OH) and
amino (-NH<span class="su">2</span>) groups. According to the modern theory of auxochromic
action, the introduction of a group into the molecule is
accompanied by some strain, and the alteration in colour produced
is connected with the magnitude of the strain. The amino group is
more powerful than the hydroxyl, and the substituted amino group
more powerful still; the repeated substitution of hydroxyl groups
sometimes causes an intensification and sometimes a diminution of
colour.</p>

<p>We may here notice an empirical rule formulated by Nietzski in
1879:&mdash;the simplest colouring substances are in the greenish-yellow
and yellow, and with increasing molecular weight the colour passes
into orange, red, violet, blue and green. This rule, however, is by
no means perfect. Examination of the absorption spectra of coloured
compounds shows that certain groupings displace the absorption
bands in one direction, and other groupings in the other. If the
bands be displaced towards the violet, involving a regression through
the colours mentioned above, the group is said to be &ldquo;hypsochromic&rdquo;;
if the reverse occurs the group is &ldquo;bathochromic.&rdquo; It
may be generally inferred that an increase in molecular weight is
accompanied by a change in colour in the direction of the violet.</p>

<p>Auxochromic groups generally aid one another, <i>i.e.</i> the tint
deepens as the number of auxochromes increases. Also the relative
position of the auxochrome to the chromophore influences colour,
the ortho-position being generally the most powerful. Kauffmann
(<i>Ber.</i>, 1906, 39, p. 1959) attempted an evaluation of the effects of
auxochromic groups by means of the magnetic optical constants.
The method is based on the supposition that the magnetic rotation
measures the strain produced in the molecule by an auxochrome,
and he arranges the groups in the following order:&mdash;</p>

<p>The phenomena attending the salt formation of coloured and
colouring substances are important. The chromophoric groups are
rarely strongly acid or basic; on the other hand, the auxochromes
are strongly acid or basic and form salts very readily. Notable
differences attend the neutralization of the chromophoric and
auxochromic groups. With basic substances, the chromophoric combination
with a colourless acid is generally attended by a deepening in
colour; auxochromic combination, on the other hand, with a lessening.
Examples of the first case are found among the colourless
acridines and quinoxalines which give coloured salts; of the second
case we may notice the colourless hydrochloride and sulphate of the
deep yellow o-aminobenzophenone. With acid substances, the combination
with &ldquo;colourless&rdquo; metals, <i>i.e.</i> metals producing colourless
salts with acids, is attended by colour changes contrary to those
given above, auxochromic combination being accompanied by a
deepening, and chromophoric by a lessening of the tint.</p>

<p>Mention may be made of the phenomenon of halochromism, the
name given to the power of colourless or faintly-coloured substances
of combining with acids to form highly-coloured substances without
the necessary production of a chromophoric group. The researches
of Adolf von Baeyer and Villiger, Kehrmann, Kauffmann and others,
show that this property is possessed by very many and varied
substances. In many cases it may be connected with basic oxygen,
and the salt formation is assumed to involve the passage of divalent
into tetravalent oxygen. It seems that intermolecular change also
occurs, but further research is necessary before a sound theory can
be stated.</p>

<p><i>Quinone Theory of Colour.</i>&mdash;A theory of colour in opposition to
the Witt theory was proposed by Henry Armstrong in 1888 and 1892.
This assumed that all coloured substances were derivatives of ortho- or
para-quinone (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Quinones</a></span>), and although at the time of its
promotion little practical proof was given, yet the theory found
wide acceptance on account of the researches of many other chemists.
It follows on this theory that all coloured substances contain either
of the groupings</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:167px; height:40px" src="images/img71c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">the former being a para-quinonoid, the latter an ortho-quinonoid.
While very many coloured substances must obviously contain this
grouping, yet in many cases it is necessary to assume a simple
intermolecular change, while in others a more complex rearrangement
of bonds is necessary. Quinone, which is light yellow in colour, is
the simplest coloured substance on this theory. Hydrocarbons
of similar structure have been prepared by Thiele, for example, the
orange-yellow tetraphenyl-<i>para</i>-xylylene, which is obtained by
boiling the bromide C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>[CBr(C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">2</span>]<span class="su">2</span> with benzene and
molecular silver. The quinonoid structure of many coloured compounds has
been proved experimentally, as, for example, by Hewitt for the
benzene-azo-phenols, and Hantzsch for triaminotriphenyl methane
and acridine derivatives; but, at the same time, many substances
cannot be so explained. A notable example is provided by the
phthaleins, which result by the condensation of phthalic anhydride
with phenols. In the free state these substances are colourless,
and were assumed to have the formula shown in 1. Solution in
dilute alkali was supposed to be accompanied by the rupture of the
lactone ring with the formation of the quinonoid salt shown in 2.</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:220px; height:75px" src="images/img71d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Baeyer (<i>Ber.</i>, 1905, 38, p. 569) and Silberrad (<i>Journ. Chem. Soc.</i>,
1906, 89, p. 1787) have disputed the correctness of this explanation,
and the latter has prepared melliteins and pyromelliteins, which are
highly-coloured compounds produced from mellitic and pyromellitic
acids, and which cannot be formulated as quinones. Baeyer has
suggested that the nine carbon atom system of xanthone may act as a
chromophore. An alternative view, due to Green, is that the oxygen
atom of the xanthone ring is tetravalent, a supposition which permits
the formulation of these substances as ortho-quinonoids.</p>

<p>The theories of colour have also been investigated by Hantzsch,
who first considered the nitro-phenols. On the chromophore-auxochrome
theory (the nitro group being the chromophore, and the
hydroxyl the auxochrome) it is necessary in order to explain the high
colour of the metallic salts and the colourless alkyl and aryl derivatives
to assume that the auxochromic action of the hydroxyl group is only
brought strongly into evidence by salt formation. Armstrong, on
the other hand, assumed an intermolecular change, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:214px; height:45px" src="images/img71e.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">The proof of this was left for Hantzsch, who traced a connexion
with the nitrolic acids of V. Meyer, which are formed when nitrous
acid acts on primary aliphatic nitro compounds. Meyer formulated
these compounds as nitroximes or nitro-isnitroso derivatives, viz.
R·C(NO<span class="su">2</span>)(NOH). Hantzsch explains the transformation of the
colourless acid into red salts, which on standing yield more stable,
colourless salts, by the following scheme:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:354px; height:50px" src="images/img71f.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">He has also shown that the nitrophenols yield, in addition to the
colourless true nitrophenol ethers, an isomeric series of coloured unstable
quinonoid <i>aci</i>-ethers, which have practically the same colour
and yield the same absorption spectra as the coloured metallic
salts. He suggests that the term &ldquo;quinone&rdquo; theory be abandoned,
and replaced by the <i>Umlagerungs</i> theory, since this term implies
some intermolecular rearrangement, and does not connote simply
benzenoid compounds as does &ldquo;quinonoid.&rdquo; H. von Liebig (<i>Ann.</i>,
1908, 360, p. 128), from a very complete discussion of triphenyl-methane
derivatives, concluded that the grouping
<img style="width:43px; height:25px" src="images/img71g.jpg" alt="" />
was the only true organic chromophore, colour production, however,
requiring another condition, usually the closing of a ring.</p>
</div>

<p>The views as to the question of colour and constitution may be
summarized as follows:&mdash;(1) The quinone theory (Armstrong,
Gomberg, R. Meyer) regards all coloured substances as having
a quinonoid structure. (2) The chromophore-auxochrome
theory (Kauffmann) regards colour as due to the entry of an
&ldquo;auxochrome&rdquo; into a &ldquo;chromophoric&rdquo; molecule. (3) If a
colourless compound gives a coloured one on solution or by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
salt-formation, the production of colour may be explained as a
particular form of ionization (Baeyer), or by a molecular
rearrangement (Hantzsch). A dynamical theory due to E.C.C.
Baly regards colour as due to &ldquo;isorropesis&rdquo; or an oscillation
between the residual affinities of adjacent atoms composing the
molecule.</p>

<p><i>Fluorescence and Constitution.</i>&mdash;The physical investigation
of the phenomenon named fluorescence&mdash;the property of
transforming incident light into light of different refrangibility&mdash;is
treated in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fluorescence</a></span>. Researches in synthetical
organic chemistry have shown that this property of
fluorescence is common to an immense number of substances,
and theories have been proposed whose purpose is to connect
the property with constitution.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1897 Richard Meyer (<i>Zeit. physik. Chemie</i>, 24, p. 468) submitted
the view that fluorescence was due to the presence of certain
&ldquo;fluorophore&rdquo; groups; such groupings are the pyrone ring and its congeners,
the central rings in anthracene and acridine derivatives,
and the paradiazine ring in safranines. A novel theory, proposed
by J.T. Hewitt in 1900 (<i>Zeit. f. physik. Chemie</i>, 34, p. 1;
<i>B.A. Report</i>,
1903, p. 628, and later papers in the <i>Journ. Chem. Soc.</i>), regards the
property as occasioned by internal vibrations within the molecule
conditioned by a symmetrical double tautomerism, light of one
wave-length being absorbed by one form, and emitted with a different
wave-length by the other. This oscillation may be represented in
the case of acridine and fluorescein as</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:471px; height:70px" src="images/img72a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">This theory brings the property of fluorescence into relation with
that of colour; the forms which cause fluorescence being the coloured
modifications: ortho-quinonoid in the case of acridine, para-quinonoid
in the case of fluorescein. H. Kauffmann (<i>Ber.</i>, 1900, 33,
p. 1731; 1904, 35, p. 294; 1905, 38, p. 789; <i>Ann.</i>, 1906, 344, p. 30)
suggested that the property is due to the presence of at least two
groups. The first group, named the &ldquo;luminophore,&rdquo; is such that
when excited by suitable aetherial vibrations emits radiant energy;
the other, named the &ldquo;fluorogen,&rdquo; acts with the luminophore in
some way or other to cause the fluorescence. This theory explains
the fluorescence of anthranilic acid (o-aminobenzoic acid), by regarding
the aniline residue as the luminophore, and the carboxyl group
as the fluorogen, since, apparently, the introduction of the latter
into the non-fluorescent aniline molecule involves the production of
a fluorescent substance. Although the theories of Meyer and
Hewitt do not explain (in their present form) the behaviour of
anthranilic acid, yet Hewitt has shown that his theory goes far to
explain the fluorescence of substances in which a double symmetrical
tautomerism is possible. This tautomerism may be of a twofold
nature:&mdash;(1) it may involve the mere oscillation of linkages, as in
acridine; or (2) it may involve the oscillation of atoms, as in
fluorescein. A theory of a physical nature, based primarily upon Sir
J.J. Thomson&rsquo;s theory of corpuscles, has been proposed by J. de
Kowalski (<i>Compt. rend.</i> 1907, 144, p. 266). We may notice that
ethyl oxalosuccinonitrile is the first case of a fluorescent aliphatic
compound (see W. Wislicenus and P. Berg, <i>Ber.</i>, 1908, 41, p. 3757).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Capillarity and Surface Tension.</i>&mdash;Reference should be made
to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Capillary Action</a></span> for the general discussion of this
phenomenon of liquids. It is there shown that the surface
tension of a liquid may be calculated from its rise in a capillary
tube by the formula &gamma; = &frac12;rhs, where &gamma; is the surface tension
per square centimetre, r the radius of the tube, h the height of the
liquid column, and s the difference between the densities of
the liquid and its vapour. At the critical point liquid and vapour
become identical, and, consequently, as was pointed out by
Frankenheim in 1841, the surface tension is zero at the critical
temperature.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Mendeléeff endeavoured to obtain a connexion between surface
energy and constitution; more successful were the investigations
of Schiff, who found that the &ldquo;molecular surface tension,&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote">Relation to molecular weight.</span>
which he defined as the surface tension divided by the
molecular weight, is constant for isomers, and that two
atoms of hydrogen were equal to one of carbon, three to
one of oxygen, and seven to one of chlorine; but these ratios were
by no means constant, and afforded practically no criteria as to the
molecular weight of any substance.</p>

<p>In 1886 R. Eötvös (<i>Wied. Ann.</i> 27, p. 452), assuming that two
liquids may be compared when the ratios of the volumes of the liquids
to the volumes of the saturated vapours are the same, deduced that
&gamma;V<span class="sp">2/3</span> (where &gamma; is the surface tension, and V the molecular
volume of the liquid) causes all liquids to have the same temperature
coefficients. This theorem was investigated by Sir W. Ramsay and
J. Shields (<i>Journ. Chem. Soc.</i> 63, p. 1089; 65, p. 167), whose results
have thrown considerable light on the subject of the molecular
complexity of liquids. Ramsay and Shields suggested that there
exists an equation for the surface energy of liquids, analogous to the
volume-energy equation of gases, PV = RT. The relation they
suspected to be of the form &gamma;S = KT, where K is a constant analogous
to R, and S the surface containing one gramme-molecule, &gamma; and T
being the surface tension and temperature respectively. Obviously
equimolecular surfaces are given by (Mv)<span class="sp">2/3</span>, where M is the molecular
weight of the substance, for equimolecular volumes are Mv, and
corresponding surfaces the two-thirds power of this. Hence S may
be replaced by (Mv)<span class="sp">2/3</span>. Ramsay and Shields found from investigations
of the temperature coefficient of the surface energy that T in the
equation &gamma;(Mv)<span class="sp">2/3</span> = KT must be counted downwards from the critical
temperature T less about 6°. Their surface energy equation therefore
assumes the form &gamma;(Mv)<span class="sp">2/3</span> = K(&tau; - 6°). Now the value of K,
&gamma; being measured in dynes and M being the molecular weight of the
substance as a gas, is in general 2.121; this value is never exceeded, but in
many cases it is less. This diminution implies an association of
molecules, the surface containing fewer molecules than it is supposed
to. Suppose the coefficient of association be n, <i>i.e.</i> n is the mean
number of molecules which associate to form one molecule, then by
the normal equation we have &gamma;(Mnv)<span class="sp">2/3</span> = 2.121(&tau; - 6°); if the
calculated constant be K<span class="su">1</span>, then we have also
&gamma;(Mv)<span class="sp">2/3</span> = K<span class="su">1</span>(&tau;-6°).  By
division we obtain n<span class="sp">2/3</span> = 2.121/K<span class="su">1</span>, or n = (2.121/K<span class="su">1</span>)<span class="sp">3/2</span> the
coefficient of association being thus determined.</p>

<p>The apparatus devised by Ramsay and Shields consisted of a
capillary tube, on one end of which was blown a bulb provided with
a minute hole. Attached to the bulb was a glass rod and then a tube
containing iron wire. This tube was placed in an outer tube containing
the liquid to be experimented with; the liquid is raised to its
boiling-point, and then hermetically sealed. The whole is enclosed
in a jacket connected with a boiler containing a liquid, the vapour
of which serves to keep the inner tube at any desired temperature.
The capillary tube can be raised or lowered at will by running a
magnet outside the tube, and the heights of the columns are measured
by a cathetometer or micrometer microscope.</p>

<p>Normal values of K were given by nitrogen peroxide, N<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, sulphur
chloride, S<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>, silicon tetrachloride, SiCl<span class="su">4</span>, phosphorus chloride,

disulphide, benzene, pyridine, ether, methyl propyl ketone; association
characterized many hydroxylic compounds: for ethyl alcohol
the factor of association was 2.74-2-43, for n-propyl alcohol 2.86-2.72,
acetic acid 3.62-2.77, acetone 1.26, water 3.81-2.32; phenol,
nitric acid, sulphuric acid, nitroethane, and propionitril, also exhibit
association.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Crystalline Form and Composition.</i></p>

<p>The development of the theory of crystal structure, and the
fundamental principles on which is based the classification of
crystal forms, are treated in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crystallography</a></span>; in
the same place will be found an account of the doctrine of
isomorphism, polymorphism and morphotropy. Here we shall
treat the latter subjects in more detail, viewed from the
standpoint of the chemist. Isomorphism may be defined as the
existence of two or more different substances in the same crystal
form and structure, polymorphism as the existence of the same
substance in two or more crystal modifications, and morphotropy
(after P. von Groth) as the change in crystal form due to alterations
in the molecule of closely (chemically) related substances.
In order to permit a comparison of crystal forms, from which
we hope to gain an insight into the prevailing molecular conditions,
it is necessary that some unit of crystal dimensions must
be chosen. A crystal may be regarded as built up of primitive
parallelepipeda, the edges of which are in the ratio of the
crystallographic axes, and the angles the axial angles of the
crystals. To reduce these figures to a common standard, so
that the volumes shall contain equal numbers of molecules,
the notion of molecular volumes is introduced, the arbitrary
values of the crystallographic axes (a, b, c) being replaced by the
topic parameters<a name="FnAnchor_18b" id="FnAnchor_18b" href="#Footnote_18b"><span class="sp">18</span></a> (&chi;,&psi;,&omega;), which are such that, combined with
the axial angles, they enclose volumes which contain equal
numbers of molecules. The actual values of the topic parameters
can then readily be expressed in terms of the elements of
the crystals (the axial ratios and angles), the density, and the
molecular weight (see Groth, <i>Physikalische Krystallographie</i>, or
<i>Chemical Crystallography</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
<i>Polymorphism.</i>&mdash;On the theory that crystal form and structure
are the result of the equilibrium between the atoms and molecules
composing the crystals, it is probable, <i>a priori</i>, that the same
substance may possess different equilibrium configurations of
sufficient stability, under favourable conditions, to form different
crystal structures. Broadly this phenomenon is termed polymorphism;
however, it is necessary to examine closely the diverse
crystal modifications in order to determine whether they are
really of different symmetry, or whether twinning has occasioned
the apparent difference. In the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Crystallography</a></span> the
nature and behaviour of twinned crystals receives full treatment;
here it is sufficient to say that when the planes and axes
of twinning are planes and axes of symmetry, a twin would
exhibit higher symmetry (but remain in the same crystal system)
than the primary crystal; and, also, if a crystal approximates
in its axial constants to a higher system, mimetic twinning
would increase the approximation, and the crystal would be
pseudo-symmetric.</p>

<p>In general, polysymmetric and polymorphous modifications
suffer transformation when submitted to variations in either
temperature or pressure, or both. The criterion whether
a pseudo-symmetric form is a true polymorph or not consists
in the determination of the scalar properties (<i>e.g.</i> density,
specific heat, &amp;c.) of the original and the resulting modification,
a change being in general recorded only when polymorphism
exists. Change of temperature usually suffices to determine
this, though in certain cases a variation in pressure is
necessary; for instance, sodium magnesium uranyl acetate,
NaMg(UO<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">3</span>(C<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">9</span>·9H<span class="su">2</span>O
shows no change in density unless
the observations are conducted under a considerable pressure.
Although many pseudo-symmetric twins are transformable into
the simpler form, yet, in some cases, a true polymorph results,
the change being indicated, as before, by alterations in scalar
(as well as vector) properties.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For example, boracite forms pseudo-cubic crystals which become
truly cubic at 265°, with a distinct change in density; leucite
behaves similarly at about 560°. Again, the pyroxenes, RSiO<span class="su">3</span>
(R = Fe, Mg, Mn, &amp;c.), assume the forms (1) monoclinic, sometimes
twinned so as to become pseudo-rhombic; (2) rhombic, resulting
from the pseudo-rhombic structure of (1) becoming ultramicroscopic;
and (3) triclinic, distinctly different from (1) and (2); (1) and (2)
are polysymmetric modifications, while (3) and the pair (1) and (2)
are polymorphs.</p>
</div>

<p>While polysymmetry is solely conditioned by the manner
in which the mimetic twin is built up from the single crystals,
there being no change in the scalar properties, and the vector
properties being calculable from the nature of the twinning,
in the case of polymorphism entirely different structures present
themselves, both scalar and vector properties being altered;
and, in the present state of our knowledge, it is impossible to
foretell the characters of a polymorphous modification. We may
conclude that in polymorphs the substance occurs in different
phases (or molecular aggregations), and the equilibrium between
these phases follows definite laws, being dependent upon
temperature and pressure, and amenable to thermodynamic treatment
(cf. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chemical Action</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Energetics</a></span>). The transformation
of polymorphs presents certain analogies to the solidification
of a liquid. Liquids may be cooled below their freezing-point
without solidification, the <i>metastable</i> (after W. Ostwald) form
so obtained being immediately solidified on the introduction
of a particle of the solid modification; and supersaturated
solutions behave in a similar manner. At the same time there
may be conditions of temperature and pressure at which polymorphs
may exist side by side.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="figright1" style="float: right;"><img style="width:250px; height:293px" src="images/img73a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The above may be illustrated by considering the equilibrium
between rhombic and monoclinic sulphur. The former, which is
deposited from solutions, is transformed into monoclinic sulphur
at about 96°, but with great care it is possible to overheat it and
even to fuse it (at 113.5°) without effecting the transformation.
Monoclinic sulphur, obtained by crystallizing fused sulphur, melts
at 119.5°, and admits of undercooling even to ordinary temperatures,
but contact with a fragment of the rhombic modification spontaneously
brings about the transformation. From Reicher&rsquo;s determinations,
the exact transition point is 95.6°; it rises with increasing
pressure about 0.05° for one atmosphere; the density of the rhombic
form is greater than that of the monoclinic. The equilibria of these
modifications may be readily represented on a pressure-temperature
diagram. If OT, OP (fig. 6), be the axes of temperature and pressure,
and A corresponds to the transition point (95.6°) of rhombic sulphur,
we may follow out the line AB which shows the elevation of the
transition point with increasing pressure. The overheating curve of
rhombic sulphur extends along the curve
AC, where C is the melting-point of
monoclinic sulphur. The line BC, representing
the equilibrium between monoclinic
and liquid sulphur, is thermodynamically
calculable; the point B is
found to correspond to 131° and 400
atmospheres. From B the curve of
equilibrium (BD) between rhombic and
liquid sulphur proceeds; and from C
(along CE) the curve of equilibrium
between liquid sulphur and sulphur
vapour. Of especial interest is the
curve BD: along this line liquid and
rhombic sulphur are in equilibrium, which
means that at above 131° and 400 atmospheres the rhombic (and
not the monoclinic) variety would separate from liquid sulphur.</p>

<p>Mercuric iodide also exhibits dimorphism. When precipitated
from solutions it forms red tetragonal crystals, which, on careful
heating, give a yellow rhombic form, also obtained by crystallization
from the fused substance, or by sublimation. The transition point
is 126.3° (W. Schwarz, <i>Zeit. f. Kryst.</i> 25, p. 613), but both
modifications may exist in metastable forms at higher and lower temperatures
respectively; the rhombic form may be cooled down to ordinary
temperature without changing, the transformation, however, being
readily induced by a trace of the red modification, or by friction.
The density and specific heat of the tetragonal form are greater
than those of the yellow.</p>

<p>Hexachlorethane is trimorphous, forming rhombic, triclinic and
cubic crystals; the successive changes occur at about 44° and 71°,
and are attended by a decrease in density.</p>

<p>Tetramorphism is exhibited by ammonium nitrate. According to
O. Lehmann it melts at 168° (or at a slightly lower temperature in
its water of crystallization) and on cooling forms optically isotropic
crystals; at 125.6° the mass becomes doubly refracting, and from
a solution rhombohedral (optically uniaxial) crystals are deposited;
by further cooling acicular rhombic crystals are produced at 82.8°,
and at 32.4° other rhombic forms are obtained, identical with the
product obtained by crystallizing at ordinary temperatures. The
reverse series of transformations occurs when this final modification
is heated. M. Bellati and R. Romanese (<i>Zeit. f. Kryst.</i> 14, p. 78)
determined the densities and specific heats of these modifications.
The first and third transformations (reckoned in order with increasing
temperature of the transition point) are attended by an
increase in volume, the second with a contraction; the solubility
follows the same direction, increasing up to 82.8°, then diminishing
up to 125.6°, and then increasing from this temperature upwards.</p>
</div>

<p>The physical conditions under which polymorphous modifications
are prepared control the form which the substance assumes.
We have already seen that temperature and pressure exercise
considerable influence in this direction. In the case of separation
from solutions, either by crystallization or by precipitation by
double decomposition, the temperature, the concentration of
the solution, and the presence of other ions may modify the
form obtained. In the case of sodium dihydrogen phosphate,
NaH<span class="su">2</span>PO<span class="su">4</span>·H<span class="su">2</span>O, a stable rhombic form is obtained from warm
solutions, while a different, unstable, rhombic form is obtained
from cold solutions. Calcium carbonate separates as hexagonal
calcite from cold solutions (below 30°), and as rhombic aragonite
from solutions at higher temperatures; lead and strontium
carbonates, however, induce the separation of aragonite at lower
temperatures. From supersaturated solutions the form unstable
at the temperature of the experiment is, as a rule, separated,
especially on the introduction of a crystal of the unstable form;
and, in some cases, similar inoculation of the fused substance
is attended by the same result. Different modifications may
separate and exist side by side at one and the same time from
a solution; <i>e.g.</i> telluric acid forms cubic and monoclinic crystals
from a hot nitric acid solution, and ammonium fluosilicate gives
cubic and hexagonal forms from aqueous solutions between
6° and 13°.</p>

<p>A comparison of the transformation of polymorphs leads to
a twofold classification: (1) polymorphs directly convertible
in a reversible manner&mdash;termed &ldquo;enantiotropic&rdquo; by O. Lehmann
and (2) polymorphs in which the transformation proceeds in
one direction only&mdash;termed &ldquo;monotropic.&rdquo; In the first class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
are included sulphur and ammonium nitrate; monotropy is
exhibited by aragonite and calcite.</p>

<p>It is doubtful indeed whether any general conclusions can yet
be drawn as to the relations between crystal structure and scalar
properties and the relative stability of polymorphs. As a
general rule the modification stable at higher temperatures
possesses a lower density; but this is by no means always the
case, since the converse is true for antimonious and arsenious
oxides, silver iodide and some other substances. Attempts to
connect a change of symmetry with stability show equally a lack
of generality. It is remarkable that a great many polymorphous
substances assume more symmetrical forms at higher temperatures,
and a possible explanation of the increase in density of
such compounds as silver iodide, &amp;c., may be sought for in the
theory that the formation of a more symmetrical configuration
would involve a drawing together of the molecules, and consequently
an increase in density. The insufficiency of this argument,
however, is shown by the data for arsenious and antimonious
oxides, and also for the polymorphs of calcium carbonate,
the more symmetrical polymorphs having a lower density.</p>

<p><i>Morphotropy.</i>&mdash;Many instances have been recorded where
substitution has effected a deformation in one particular direction,
the crystals of homologous compounds often exhibiting the same
angles between faces situated in certain zones. The observations
of Slavik (<i>Zeit. f. Kryst.</i>, 1902, 36, p. 268) on ammonium and
the quaternary ammonium iodides, of J.A. Le Bel and A. Ries
(<i>Zeit. f. Kryst.</i>, 1902, 1904, et seq.) on the substituted
ammonium chlorplatinates, and of G. Mez (ibid., 1901, 35, p. 242) on
substituted ureas, illustrate this point.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Ammonium iodide assumes cubic forms with perfect cubic cleavage;
tetramethyl ammonium iodide is tetragonal with perfect cleavages
parallel to {100} and {001}&mdash;a difference due to the lengthening of
the a axes; tetraethyl ammonium iodide also assumes tetragonal
forms, but does not exhibit the cleavage of the tetramethyl compound;
while tetrapropyl ammonium iodide crystallizes in rhombic
form. The equivalent volumes and topic parameters are tabulated:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From these figures it is obvious that the first three compounds
form a morphotropic series; the equivalent volumes exhibit a
regular progression; the values of &chi; and &psi;, corresponding to the a
axes, are regularly increased, while the value of &omega;, corresponding
to the c axis, remains practically unchanged. This points to the
conclusion that substitution has been effected in one of the cube
faces. We may therefore regard the nitrogen atoms as occupying
the centres of a cubic space lattice composed of iodine atoms, between
which the hydrogen atoms are distributed on the tetrahedron face
normals. Coplanar substitution in four hydrogen atoms would
involve the pushing apart of the iodine atoms in four horizontal
directions. The magnitude of this separation would obviously
depend on the magnitude of the substituent group, which may be
so large (in this case propyl is sufficient) as to cause unequal horizontal
deformation and at the same time a change in the vertical direction.</p>
</div>

<p>The measure of the loss of symmetry associated with the introduction
of alkyl groups depends upon the relative magnitudes
of the substituent group and the rest of the molecule; and the
larger the molecule, the less would be the morphotropic effect
of any particular substituent. The mere retention of the same
crystal form by homologous substances is not a sufficient reason
for denying a morphotropic effect to the substituent group;
for, in the case of certain substances crystallizing in the cubic
system, although the crystal form remains unaltered, yet the
structures vary. When both the crystal form and structure are
retained, the substances are said to be isomorphous.</p>

<p>Other substituent groups exercise morphotropic effects similar
to those exhibited by the alkyl radicles; investigations have
been made on halogen-, hydroxy-, and nitro-derivatives of
benzene and substituted benzenes. To Jaeger is due the determination
of the topic parameters of certain haloid-derivatives,
and, while showing that the morphotropic effects closely resemble
those occasioned by methyl, he established the important fact
that, in general, the crystal form depended upon the orientation
of the substituents in the benzene complex.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Benzoic acid is pseudo-tetragonal, the principal axis being remarkably
long; there is no cleavage at right angles to this axis. Direct
nitration gives (principally) m-nitrobenzoic acid, also
pseudo-tetragonal with a much shorter principal axis. From this two
chlornitrobenzoic acids [COOH·NO<span class="su">2</span>·Cl = 1.3.6 and 1.3.4] may be
obtained. These are also pseudotetragonal; the (1.3.6) acid has nearly
the same values of &chi; and &psi; as benzoic acid, but &omega; is increased;
compared with m-nitrobenzoic acid, &chi; and &psi; have been diminished,
whereas &omega; is much increased; the (1.3.4) acid is more closely
related to m-nitrobenzoic acid, &chi; and &psi; being increased, &omega;
diminished. The results obtained for the (1.2) and (1.4) chlorbenzoic acids
also illustrate the dependence of crystal form and structure on the
orientation of the molecule.</p>

<p>The hydroxyl group also resembles the methyl group in its morphotropic
effects, producing, in many cases, no change in symmetry but
a dimensional increase in one direction. This holds for benzene and
phenol, and is supported by the observations of Gossner on [1.3.5]
trinitrobenzene and picric acid (1.3.5-trinitro, 2 oxybenzene);
these last two substances assume rhombic forms, and picric acid
differs from trinitrobenzene in having &omega; considerably greater,
with &chi; and &psi; slightly less. A similar change, in one direction only,
characterizes benzoic acid and salicylic acid.</p>

<p>The nitro group behaves very similarly to the hydroxyl group.
The effect of varying the position of the nitro group in the molecule
is well marked, and conclusions may be drawn as to the orientation
of the groups from a knowledge of the crystal form; a change in
the symmetry of the chemical molecule being often attended by a
loss in the symmetry of the crystal.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be generally concluded that the substitution of alkyl,
nitro, hydroxyl, and haloid groups for hydrogen in a molecule
occasions a deformation of crystal structure in one definite
direction, hence permitting inferences as to the configuration
of the atoms composing the crystal; while the nature and degree
of the alteration depends (1) upon the crystal structure of the
unsubstituted compound; (2) on the nature of the substituting
radicle; (3) on the complexity of the substituted molecule;
and (4) on the orientation of the substitution derivative.</p>

<p><i>Isomorphism.</i>&mdash;It has been shown that certain elements and
groups exercise morphotropic effects when substituted in a
compound; it may happen that the effects due to two or more
groups are nearly equivalent, and consequently the resulting
crystal forms are nearly identical. This phenomenon was first
noticed in 1822 by E. Mitscherlich, in the case of the acid phosphate
and acid arsenate of potassium, KH<span class="su">2</span>P(As)O<span class="su">4</span>, who adopted
the term isomorphism, and regarded phosphorus and arsenic as
isomorphously related elements. Other isomorphously related
elements and groups were soon perceived, and it has been shown
that elements so related are also related chemically.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Tutton&rsquo;s investigations of the morphotropic effects of the metals
potassium, rubidium and caesium, in combination with the acid
radicals of sulphuric and selenic acids, showed that the replacement
of potassium by rubidium, and this metal in turn by caesium, was
accompanied by progressive changes in both physical and crystallographical
properties, such that the rubidium salt was always intermediate
between the salts of potassium and caesium (see table;
the space unit is taken as a pseudo-hexagonal prism). This fact finds
a parallel in the atomic weights of these metals.</p>

<p>By taking appropriate differences the following facts will be
observed: (1) the replacement of potassium by rubidium occasions
an increase in the equivalent volumes by about eight units, and of
rubidium by caesium by about eleven units; (2) replacement in the same
order is attended by a general increase in the three topic parameters, a
greater increase being met with in the replacement of rubidium by
caesium; (3) the parameters &chi; and &psi; are about equally increased,
while the increase in &omega; is always the greatest. Now consider the
effect of replacing sulphur by selenium. It will be seen that (1) the
increase in equivalent volume is about 6.6; (2) all the topic parameters
are increased; (3) the greatest increase is effected in the
parameters &chi; and &psi;, which are equally lengthened.</p>

<p>These observations admit of ready explanation in the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
manner. The ordinary structural formula of potassium sulphate is
<img style="width:61px; height:35px" src="images/img75a.jpg" alt="" />
If the crystal structure be regarded as composed of
three interpenetrating point systems, one consisting of sulphur
atoms, the second of four times as many oxygen atoms, and the
third of twice as many potassium atoms, the systems being so arranged
that the sulphur system is always centrally situated with respect
to the other two, and the potassium system so that it would affect
the vertical axis, then it is obvious that the replacement of potassium
by an element of greater atomic weight would specially increase the
length of &omega; (corresponding to the vertical axis), and cause a smaller
increase in the horizontal parameters &chi; and &psi;; moreover, the
increments would advance with the atomic weight of the replacing
metal. If, on the other hand, the sulphur system be replaced by a
corresponding selenium system, an element of higher atomic weight,
it would be expected that a slight increase would be observed in the
vertical parameter, and a greater increase recorded equally in the
horizontal parameters.</p>

<p>Muthmann (<i>Zeit. f. Kryst.</i>, 1894), in his researches on the tetragonal
potassium and ammonium dihydrogen phosphates and arsenates,
found that the replacement of potassium by ammonium was attended
by an increase of about six units in the molecular volume, and of
phosphorus by arsenic by about 4.6 units. In the topic parameters
the following changes were recorded: replacement of potassium by
ammonium was attended by a considerable increase in &omega;, &chi; and &psi;
being equally, but only slightly, increased; replacement of phosphorus
by arsenic was attended by a considerable increase, equally in &chi;
and &psi;, while &omega; suffered a smaller, but not inconsiderable, increase.
It is thus seen that the ordinary plane representation of the structure
of compounds possesses a higher significance than could have been
suggested prior to crystallographical researches.</p>
</div>

<p class="figleft1" style="float: left;"><img style="width:320px; height:427px" src="images/img75b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Identity, or approximate identity, of crystal form is not in
itself sufficient to establish true isomorphism. If a substance
deposits itself on the faces of a crystal of another substance
of similar crystal form, the substances are probably isomorphous.
Such parallel overgrowths, termed episomorphs, are very common
among the potassium and sodium felspars; and K. von Hauer
has investigated a number of cases in which salts exhibiting
episomorphism have different colours, thereby clearly demonstrating
this property of isomorphism. For example, episomorphs
of white potash alum and violet chrome alum, of white magnesium
sulphate and green nickel sulphate, and of many other
pairs of salts, have been obtained. More useful is the property
of isomorphous substances of forming mixed crystals, which
are strictly isomorphous with their constituents, for all variations
in composition. In such
crystals each component
plays its own part in determining
the physical properties;
in other words,
any physical constant of a
mixed crystal can be calculated
as additively composed
of the constants of
the two components.</p>


<div class="condensed">
<p>Fig. 7 represents the
specific volumes of mixtures
of ammonium and potassium
sulphates; the ordinates
representing specific volumes,
and the abscissae the
percentage composition of the
mixture. Fig. 8 shows the
variation of refractive index
of mixed crystals of potash
alum and thallium alum with
variation in composition.</p>

<p>In these two instances the component crystals are miscible in all
proportions; but this is by no means always the case. It may
happen that the crystals do not form double salts, and are only
miscible in certain proportions. Two cases then arise: (1) the
properties may be expressed as linear functions of the composition,
the terminal values being identical with those obtained for the
individual components, and there being a break in the curve corresponding
to the absence of mixed crystals; or (2) similar to (1) except
that different values must be assigned to the terminal values in order
to preserve collinearity. Fig. 9 illustrates the first case: the ordinates
represent specific volumes, and the abscissae denote the composition
of isomorphous mixtures of ammonium and potassium dihydrogen
phosphates, which mutually take one another up to the extent of
20% to form homogeneous crystals. The second case is illustrated
in fig. 10. Magnesium sulphate (orthorhombic) takes up ferrous
sulphate (monoclinic) to the extent of 19%, forming isomorphous
orthorhombic crystals; ferrous sulphate, on the other hand, takes
up magnesium sulphate to the extent of 54% to form monoclinic
crystals. By plotting the specific volumes of these mixed crystals
as ordinates, it is found that they fall on two lines, the upper corresponding
to the orthorhombic crystals, the lower to the monoclinic.
From this we may conclude that these salts are isodimorphous:
the upper line represents isomorphous crystals of stable orthorhombic
magnesium sulphate and unstable orthorhombic ferrous sulphate,
the lower line isomorphous
crystals of stable
monoclinic ferrous sulphate
and unstable
monoclinic magnesium
sulphate.</p>

<p class="figright1" style="float: right;"><img style="width:400px; height:424px" src="images/img75c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An important distinction
separates true mixed
crystals and crystallized
double salts, for in the
latter the properties are
not linear functions of
the properties of the
components; generally
there is a contraction in
volume, while the refractive
indices and other
physical properties do
not, in general, obey the
additive law.</p>
</div>

<p>Isomorphism is most
clearly discerned between
elements of
analogous chemical properties; and from the wide generality
of such observations attempts have been made to form a classification
of elements based on isomorphous replacements. The
following table shows where isomorphism may be generally
expected. The elements are arranged in eleven series, and the
series are subdivided (as indicated by semicolons) into groups;
these groups exhibit partial isomorphism with the other groups
of the same series (see W. Nernst, <i>Theoretical Chemistry</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEMNITZ<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Kemnitz</span>), <span class="bold">MARTIN</span> (1522-1586), German
Lutheran theologian, third son of Paul Kemnitz, a cloth-worker
of noble extraction, was born at Treuenbrietzen, Brandenburg,
on the 9th of November 1522. Left an orphan at the age of
eleven, he worked for a time at his father&rsquo;s trade. A relative at
Magdeburg put him to school there (1539-1542). Having made a
little money by teaching, he went (1543) to the university of
Frankfort-on-Oder; thence (1545) to that of Wittenberg. Here
he heard Luther preach, but was more attracted by Melanchthon,
who interested him in mathematics and astrology. Melanchthon
gave him (1547) an introduction to his son-in-law, Georg Sabinus,
at Königsberg, where he was tutor to some Polish youths, and
rector (1548) of the Kneiphof school. He practised astrology;
this recommended him to Duke Albert of Prussia, who made him
his librarian (1550). He then turned to Biblical, patristic and
kindred studies. His powers were first brought out in controversy
with Osiander on justification by faith. Osiander, maintaining
the infusion of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness into the believer,
impugned the Lutheran doctrine of imputation; Chemnitz
defended it with striking ability. As Duke Albert sided with
Osiander, Chemnitz resigned the librarianship. Returning (1553)
to Wittenberg, he lectured on Melanchthon&rsquo;s <i>Loci Communes</i>, his
lectures forming the basis of his own <i>Loci Theologici</i> (published
posthumously, 1591), which constitute probably the best exposition
of Lutheran theology as formulated and modified by
Melanchthon. His lectures were thronged, and a university career
of great influence lay before him, when he accepted a call to become
coadjutor at Brunswick to the superintendent, Joachim Mörlin,
who had known him at Königsberg. He removed to Brunswick
on the 15th of December 1554, and there spent the remainder of
his life, refusing subsequent offers of important offices from
various Protestant princes of Germany. Zealous in the duties of
his pastoral charge, he took a leading part in theological controversy.
His personal influence, at a critical period, did much to
secure strictness of doctrine and compactness of organization
in the Lutheran Church. Against Crypto-Calvinists he upheld
the Lutheran view of the eucharist in his <i>Repetitio sanae doctrinae
de Vera Praesentia</i> (1560; in German, 1561). To check the
reaction towards the old religion he wrote several works of great
power, especially his <i>Theologiae Jesuitarum praecipua capita</i>
(1562), an incisive attack on the principles of the society, and the
<i>Examen concilii Tridentini</i> (four parts, 1565-66-72-73), his
greatest work. His <i>Corpus doctrinae Prutenicum</i> (1567), drawn
up in conjunction with Mörlin, at once acquired great authority.
In the year of its publication he became superintendent of
Brunswick, and in effect the director of his church throughout
Lower Saxony. His tact was equal to his learning. In conjunction
with Andreä and Selnecker he induced the Lutherans of
Saxony and Swabia to adopt the <i>Formula Concordiae</i> and so
become one body. Against lax views of Socinian tendency he
directed his able treatise <i>De duabus naluris in Christo</i> (1570).
Resigning office in infirm health (1584) he survived till the 8th of
April 1586.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEMNITZ<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span>, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Saxony,
the capital of a governmental district, 50 m. W.S.W. of Dresden
and 51 S.E. of Leipzig by rail. Pop. (1885) 110,817; (1895)
161,017; (1905) 244,405. It lies 950 ft. above the sea, in a
fertile plain at the foot of the Erzgebirge, watered by the
river Chemnitz, an affluent of the Mulde. It is the chief
manufacturing town in the kingdom, ranks next to Dresden
and Leipzig in point of population, and is one of the principal
commercial and industrial centres of Germany. It is well
provided with railway communication, being directly connected
with Berlin and with the populous and thriving towns of the
Erzgebirge and Voigtland. Chemnitz is in general well built,
the enormous development of its industry and commerce having
of late years led to the laying out of many fine streets and
to the embellishing of the town with handsome buildings. The
centre is occupied by the market square, with the handsome
medieval Rathaus, now superseded for municipal business by a
modern building in the Post-strasse. In this square are monuments
to the emperor William I., Bismarck and Moltke. The
old inner town is surrounded by pleasant promenades, occupying
the site of the old fortifications, and it is beyond these that
industrial Chemnitz lies, girdling the old town on all sides with a
thick belt of streets and factories, and ramifying far into the
country. Chemnitz has eleven Protestant churches, among
them the ancient Gothic church of St James, with a fine porch,
and the modern churches of St Peter, St Nicholas and St Mark.
There are also a synagogue and chapels of various sects. The
industry of Chemnitz has gained for the town the name of
&ldquo;Saxon Manchester.&rdquo; First in importance are its locomotive
and engineering works, which give employment to some 20,000
hands in 90 factories. Next come its cotton-spinning, hosiery,
textile and glove manufactures, in which a large trade is done
with Great Britain and the United States. It is also the seat
of considerable dyeworks, bleachworks, chemical and woollen
factories, and produces leather and straps, cement, small vehicles,
wire-woven goods, carpets, beer and bricks. The town is well
provided with technical schools for training in the various
industries, including commercial, public, economic and agricultural
schools, and has a chamber of commerce. There are
also industrial and historical museums, and collections of painting
and natural history. The local communications are maintained
by an excellent electric tramway system. To the northwest
of the town is the Gothic church of a former Benedictine
monastery, dating from 1514-1525, with a tower of 1897.
Chemnitz is a favourite tourist centre for excursions into the
Erzgebirge, the chain of mountains separating Saxony from
Bohemia.</p>

<p>Chemnitz (<i>Kaminizi</i>) was originally a settlement of the
Serbian Wends and became a market town in 1143. Its municipal
constitution dates from the 14th century, and it soon became the
most important industrial centre in the mark of Meissen. A
monopoly of bleaching was granted to the town, and thus a
considerable trade in woollen and linen yarns was attracted to
Chemnitz; paper was made here, and in the 16th century the
manufacture of cloth was very flourishing. In 1539 the Reformation
was introduced, and in 1546 the Benedictine monastery,
founded about 1136 by the emperor Lothair II. about 2 m. north
of the town, was dissolved. During the Thirty Years&rsquo; War
Chemnitz was plundered by all parties and its trade was completely
ruined, but at the beginning of the 18th century it had
begun to recover. Further progress in this direction was made

<p><span class="bold">CHÊNEDOLLÉ, CHARLES JULIEN LIOULT DE<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1769-1833),
French poet, was born at Vire (Calvados) on the 4th of November
1769. He early showed a vocation for poetry, but the outbreak
of the Revolution temporarily diverted his energy. Emigrating
in 1791, he fought two campaigns in the army of Conde, and
eventually found his way to Hamburg, where he met Antoine de
Rivarol, of whose brilliant conversation he has left an account.
He also visited Mme de Staël in her retreat at Coppet. On his
return to Paris in 1799 he met Chateaubriand and his sister
Lucile (Mme de Caud), to whom he became deeply attached.
After her death in 1804, Chênedollé returned to Normandy,
where he married and became eventually inspector of the
academy of Caen (1812-1832). With the exception of occasional
visits to Paris, he spent the rest of his life in his native province.
He died at the château de Coisel on the 2nd of December 1833.
He published his <i>Genie de l&rsquo;Homme</i> in 1807, and in 1820 his
<i>Études poétiques</i>, which had the misfortune to appear shortly
after the <i>Méditations</i> of Lamartine, so that the author did not
receive the credit of their real originality. Chênedollé had many
sympathies with the romanticists, and was a contributor to their
organ, the <i>Muse française</i>. His other works include the <i>Esprit de
Rivarol</i> (1808) in conjunction with F.J.M. Fayolle.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The works of Chênedollé were edited in 1864 by Sainte-Beuve,
who drew portraits of him in his <i>Chateaubriand et son groupe</i> and in
an article contributed to the <i>Revue des deux mondes</i> (June 1849).

<p><span class="bold">CHENERY, THOMAS<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (1826-1884), English scholar and editor
of <i>The Times</i>, was born in 1826 at Barbados. He was educated at
Eton and Caius College, Cambridge. Having been called to the
bar, he went out to Constantinople as <i>The Times</i> correspondent
just before the Crimean War, and it was under the influence there
of Algernon Smythe (afterwards Lord Strangford) that he first
turned to those philological studies in which he became eminent.
After the war he returned to London and wrote regularly for <i>The
Times</i> for many years, eventually succeeding Delane as editor in
1877. He was then an experienced publicist, particularly well
versed in Oriental affairs, an indefatigable worker, with a rapid
and comprehensive judgment, though he lacked Delane&rsquo;s
intuition for public opinion. It was as an Orientalist, however,
that he had meantime earned the highest reputation, his
knowledge of Arabic and Hebrew being almost unrivalled and his
gift for languages exceptional. In 1868 he was appointed Lord
Almoner&rsquo;s professor of Arabic at Oxford, and retained his
position until he became editor of <i>The Times</i>. He was one of the
company of revisers of the Old Testament. He was secretary for
some time to the Royal Asiatic Society, and published learned
editions of the Arabic classic <i>The Assemblies of Al-Harir&#299;</i> and of
the <i>Machberoth Ithiel</i>. He died in London on the 11th of

<p><span class="bold">CHENG<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span>, <span class="sc">Tscheng</span> or <span class="sc">Tschiang</span> (Ger. <i>Scheng</i>), an ancient
Chinese wind instrument, a primitive organ, containing the
principle of the free reed which found application in the accordion,
concertina and harmonium. The cheng resembles a tea-pot
filled with bamboo pipes of graduated lengths. It consists of a
gourd or turned wooden receptacle acting as wind reservoir, in
the side of which is inserted an insufflation tube curved like a
swan&rsquo;s neck or the spout of a tea-pot. The cup-shaped reservoir
is closed by means of a plate of horn pierced with seventeen round
holes arranged round the edge in an unfinished circle, into which
fit the bamboo pipes. The pipes are cylindrical as far as they are
visible above the plate, but the lower end inserted in the wind
reservoir is cut to the shape of a beak, somewhat like the mouthpiece
of the clarinet, to receive the reed. The construction of the
free reed is very simple: it consists of a thin plate of metal&mdash;gold
according to the Jesuit missionary Joseph Amiot,<a name="FnAnchor_1c" id="FnAnchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but brass in
the specimens brought to Europe&mdash;of the thickness of ordinary
paper. In this plate is cut a rectangular flap or tongue which
remains fixed at one end, while at the other the tongue is filed so
that, instead of closing the aperture, it passes freely through,
vibrating as the air is forced through the pipe (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Free-Reed
Vibrator</a></span>). The metal plate is fastened with wax longitudinally
across the diameter of the beak end of the pipe, a little layer of
wax being applied also to the free end of the vibrating tongue for
the purpose of tuning by adding weight and impetus. About
half an inch above the horn plate a small round hole or stop is
bored through the pipe, which speaks only when this hole is
covered by the finger. A longitudinal aperture about an inch
long cut in the upper end of the bamboo pipe serves to determine
the length of the vibrating column of air proper to respond to the
vibrations of the free reed. The length of the bamboo above this
opening is purely ornamental, as are also four or five of the
seventeen pipes which have no reeds and do not speak, being
merely inserted for the purposes of symmetry in design. The
notes of the cheng, like those of the concertina, speak either by
inspiration or expiration of air, the former being the more usual
method. Mahillon states that performers on the cheng in China
are rare, as the method of playing by inspiration induces inflammation
of the throat.<a name="FnAnchor_2c" id="FnAnchor_2c" href="#Footnote_2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Amiot, who gives a description of the
instrument with illustrations showing the construction, states
that in the great Chinese encyclopaedia <i>Eulh-ya</i>, articles <i>Yu</i> and
<i>Ho</i>, the <i>Yu</i> of ancient China was the large cheng with nineteen
free reeds (twenty-four pipes), and the <i>Ho</i> the small cheng with
thirteen reeds or seventeen pipes described in this article. The
compass of the latter is given by him as the middle octave with
chromatic intervals, the thirteenth note giving the octave of the
first. Mahillon gives the compass of a modern cheng as follows:</p>

<p class="center1"><img style="width:550px; height:69px" src="images/img77.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="noind">E.F.F. Chladni,<a name="FnAnchor_3c" id="FnAnchor_3c" href="#Footnote_3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> who examined a cheng sent from China to Herr
Müller, organist of the church of St Nicholas, Leipzig, at the
beginning of the 19th century, gives an excellent description of
the instrument, reproducing in illustration a plate from Giulio
Ferrario&rsquo;s work on costume.<a name="FnAnchor_4c" id="FnAnchor_4c" href="#Footnote_4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Müller&rsquo;s cheng had the same
compass as Mahillon&rsquo;s. Chladni&rsquo;s article was motived by the
publication of an account of the exhibition of G.J. Grenié&rsquo;s
<i>Orgue expressif</i>, invented about 1810, in the Conservatoire of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>

about 1840, produced the harmonium. Kratzenstein (see under
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harmonium</a></span>) of St Petersburg was the first to apply the free
reed to the organ in the second half of the 18th century. Inventions
of similar instruments, which after a short life were
relegated to oblivion, followed at the beginning of the 19th
century. An interesting reproduction of a Persian cheng dating
from the 10th or 11th century is to be seen on a Persian vase
described and illustrated together with a shawm in the <i>Gazette

below) the fourth, remained in France; and after a few years,
during which André ran wild with &ldquo;la tante de Carcasonne,&rdquo; he
distinguished himself as a verse-translator from the classics at
the Collège de Navarre (the school in former days of Gerson and
Bossuet) in Paris. In 1783 he obtained a cadetship in a French
regiment at Strassburg. But the glamour of the military life
was as soon exhausted by Chénier as it was by Coleridge. He
returned to Paris before the end of the year, was well received by
his family, and mixed in the cultivated circle which frequented
the salon of his mother, among them Lebrun-Pindaré, Lavoisier,
Lesueur, Dorat, Parmy, and a little later the painter David. He
was already a poet by predilection, an idyllist and steeped in the
classical archaism of the time, when, in 1784, his taste for the
antique was confirmed by a visit to Rome made in the company
of two schoolfellows, the brothers Trudaine. From Naples, after
visiting Pompeii, he returned to Paris, his mind fermenting with
poetical images and projects, few of which he was destined to
realize. For nearly three years, however, he was enabled to
study and to experiment in verse without any active pressure or
interruption from his family&mdash;three precious years in which the
first phase of his art as a writer of idylls and bucolics, imitated to
a large extent from Theocritus, Bion and the Greek anthologists,
was elaborated. Among the poems written or at least sketched
during this period were <i>L&rsquo;Oaristys</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Aveugle</i>, <i>La Jeune Malade</i>,
<i>Bacchus</i>, <i>Euphrosine</i> and <i>La Jeune Tarentine</i>, the last a synthesis
of his purest manner, mosaic though it is of reminiscences of at
least a dozen classical poets. As in glyptic so in poetic art, the
Hellenism of the time was decadent and Alexandrine rather than
Attic of the best period. But Chénier is always far more than an
imitator. <i>La Jeune Tarentine</i> is a work of personal emotion and
inspiration. The colouring is that of classic mythology, but the
spiritual element is as individual as that of any classical poem by
Milton, Gray, Keats or Tennyson. Apart from his idylls and his
elegies, Chénier also experimented from early youth in didactic
and philosophic verse, and when he commenced his <i>Hermès</i> in
1783 his ambition was to condense the <i>Encyclopédie</i> of Diderot
into a poem somewhat after the manner of Lucretius. This poem
was to treat of man&rsquo;s position in the Universe, first in an isolated
state, and then in society. It remains fragmentary, and though
some of the fragments are fine, its attempt at scientific exposition
approximates too closely to the manner of Erasmus Darwin to
suit a modern ear. Another fragment called <i>L&rsquo;Invention</i> sums
Chénier&rsquo;s <i>Ars Poetica</i> in the verse &ldquo;Sur des pensers nouveaux,
faisons des vers antiques.&rdquo; <i>Suzanne</i> represents the torso of a
Biblical poem on a very large scale, in six cantos.</p>

<p>In the meantime, André had published nothing, and some of
these last pieces were in fact not yet written, when in November
1787 an opportunity of a fresh career presented itself. The new
ambassador at the court of St James&rsquo;s, M. de la Luzerne, was
connected in some way with the Chénier family, and he offered to
take André with him as his secretary. The offer was too good to
be refused, but the poet hated himself on the banks of the <i>fière
Tamise</i>, and wrote in bitter ridicule of</p>

<p class="noind">He seems to have been interested in the poetic diction of Milton
and Thomson, and a few of his verses are remotely inspired by
Shakespeare and Gray. To say, however, that he studied
English literature would be an exaggeration. The events of 1789
and the startling success of his younger brother, Marie-Joseph,
as political playwright and pamphleteer, concentrated all his
thoughts upon France. In April 1790 he could stand London no
longer, and once more joined his parents at Paris in the rue
de Cléry.</p>

<p>The France that he plunged into with such impetuosity was
upon the verge of anarchy. A strong constitutionalist, Chénier
took the view that the Revolution was already complete and that
all that remained to be done was the inauguration of the reign of
law. Moderate as were his views and disinterested as were his
motives, his tactics were passionately and dangerously aggressive.
From an idyllist and elegist we find him suddenly transformed
into an unsparing master of poetical satire. His prose <i>Avis au
peuple français</i> (August 24, 1790) was followed by the rhetorical
<i>Jeu de paume</i>, a somewhat declamatory moral ode addressed
&ldquo;à Louis David, peintre.&rdquo; In the meantime he orated at the
Feuillants Club, and contributed frequently to the <i>Journal de
Paris</i> from November 1791 to July 1792, when he wrote his
scorching <i>Iambes</i> to Collot d&rsquo;Herbois, <i>Sur les Suisses révoltés du
regiment de Châteauvieux</i>. The 10th of August uprooted his party,
his paper and his friends, and the management of relatives who
kept him out of the way in Normandy alone saved him from the
massacre of September. In the month following these events his
democratic brother, Marie-Joseph, had entered the Convention.
André&rsquo;s sombre rage against the course of events found vent in
the line on the Maenads who mutilated the king&rsquo;s Swiss Guard,
and in the <i>Ode à Charlotte Corday</i> congratulating France that
&ldquo;Un scélérat de moins rampe dans cette fange.&rdquo; At the express
request of Malesherbes he furnished some arguments to the
materials collected for the defence of the king. After the execution
he sought a secluded retreat on the Plateau de Satory at
Versailles and took exercise after nightfall. There he wrote the
poems inspired by Fanny (Mme Laurent Lecoulteux), including
the exquisite <i>Ode à Versailles</i>, one of his freshest, noblest and
most varied poems.</p>

<p>His solitary life at Versailles lasted nearly a year. On the 7th
of March 1794 he was taken at the house of Mme Piscatory at
Passy. Two obscure agents of the committee of public safety
were in search of a marquise who had flown, but an unknown
stranger was found in the house and arrested on suspicion.
This was André, who had come on a visit of sympathy. He was
taken to the Luxembourg and afterwards to Saint-Lazare.
During the 140 days of his imprisonment there he wrote the
marvellous <i>Iambes</i> (in alternate lines of 12 and 8 syllables), which
hiss and stab like poisoned bullets, and which were transmitted to
his family by a venal gaoler. There he wrote the best known of
all his verses, the pathetic <i>Jeune captive</i>, a poem at once of
enchantment and of despair. Suffocating in an atmosphere of
cruelty and baseness, Chénier&rsquo;s agony found expression almost to
the last in these murderous <i>Iambes</i> which he launched against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
Convention. Ten days before the end, the painter J.B. Suvée
executed the well-known portrait. He might have been overlooked
but for the well-meant, indignant officiousness of his
father. Marie-Joseph had done his best to prevent this, but he
could do nothing more. Robespierre, who was himself on the
brink of the volcano, remembered the venomous sallies in the
<i>Journal de Paris</i>. At sundown on the 25th of July 1794, the very
day of his condemnation on a bogus charge of conspiracy, André
Chénier was guillotined. The record of his last moments by La
Touche is rather melodramatic and is certainly not above
suspicion.</p>

<p>Incomplete as was his career&mdash;he was not quite thirty-two&mdash;his
life was cut short in a crescendo of all its nobler elements.
Exquisite as was already his susceptibility to beauty and his
mastership of the rarest poetic material, we cannot doubt that
Chénier was preparing for still higher flights of lyric passion and
poetic intensity. Nothing that he had yet done could be said
to compare in promise of assured greatness with the <i>Iambes</i>, the
<i>Odes</i> and the <i>Jeune Captive</i>. At the moment he left practically
nothing to tell the world of his transcendent genius, and his
reputation has had to be retrieved from oblivion page by page,
and almost poem by poem. During his lifetime only his <i>Jeu
de paume</i> (1791) and <i>Hymne sur les Suisses</i> (1792) had been
given to the world. The <i>Jeune Captive</i> appeared in the <i>Décade
philosophique</i>, Jan. 9, 1795; <i>La Jeune Tarentine</i> in the <i>Mercure</i>
of March 22, 1801. Chateaubriand quoted three or four passages
in his <i>Génie du christianisme</i>. Fayette and Lefeuvre-Deumier
also gave a few fragments; but it was not until 1819 that a
first imperfect attempt was made by H. de la Touche to collect
the poems in a substantive volume. Since the appearance of the
<i>editio princeps</i> of Chénier&rsquo;s poems in La Touche&rsquo;s volume, many
additional poems and fragments have been discovered, and an
edition of the complete works of the poet, collated with the MSS.
bequeathed to the Bibliothèque Nationale by Mme Elisa de
Chénier in 1892, has been edited by Paul Dimoff and published
by Delagrave. During the same period the critical estimates
of the poet have fluctuated in a truly extraordinary manner.
Sainte-Beuve in his <i>Tableau</i> of 1828 sang the praises of Chénier
as an heroic forerunner of the Romantic movement and a
precursor of Victor Hugo. Chénier, he said, had &ldquo;inspired and
determined&rdquo; Romanticism. This suggestion of modernity in
Chénier was echoed by a chorus of critics who worked the idea
to death; in the meantime, the standard edition of Chénier&rsquo;s
works was being prepared by M. Becq de Fouquières and was
issued in 1862, but rearranged and greatly improved by the
editor in 1872. The same patient investigator gave his New
Documents on André Chénier to the world in 1875.</p>

<p>In the second volume of <i>La Vie littéraire</i> Anatole France
contests the theory of Sainte-Beuve. Far from being an initiator,
he maintains that Chénier&rsquo;s poetry is the last expression of an
expiring form of art. His matter and his form belong of right
to the classic spirit of the 18th century. He is a contemporary,
not of Hugo and Leconte de Lisle, but of Suard and Morellet.
M. Faguet sums up on the side of M. France in his volume on the
18th century (1890). Chénier&rsquo;s real disciples, according to the
latest view, are Leconte de Lisle and M. de Heredia, <i>mosaïstes</i>
who have at heart the cult of antique and pagan beauty, of
&ldquo;pure art&rdquo; and of &ldquo;objective poetry.&rdquo; Heredia himself
reverted to the judgment of Sainte-Beuve to the effect that
Chénier was the first to make modern verses, and he adds,
&ldquo;I do not know in the French language a more exquisite fragment
than the three hundred verses of the <i>Bucoliques</i>.&rdquo; Chénier&rsquo;s
influence has been specially remarkable in Russia, where Pushkin
imitated him, Kogloff translated <i>La Jeune Captive</i>, <i>La jeune
Tarentine</i> and other famous pieces, while the critic Vesselovsky
pronounces &ldquo;Il a rétabli le lyrisme pur dans la poésie française.&rdquo;
The general French verdict on his work is in the main well
summed by Morillot, when he says that, judged by the usual
tests of the Romantic movement of the &rsquo;twenties (love for strange
literatures of the North, medievalism, novelties and experiments),
Chénier would inevitably have been excluded from the <i>cénacle</i> of
1827. On the other hand, he exhibits a decided tendency to
the world-ennui and melancholy which was one of the earlier
symptoms of the movement, and he has experimented in French
verse in a manner which would have led to his excommunication
by the typical performers of the 18th century. What is universally
admitted is that Chénier was a very great artist, who like
Ronsard opened up sources of poetry in France which had long
seemed dried up. In England it is easier to feel his attraction
than that of some far greater reputations in French poetry, for,
rhetorical though he nearly always is, he yet reveals something
of that quality which to the Northern mind has always been of
the very essence of poetry, that quality which made Sainte-Beuve
say of him that he was the first great poet &ldquo;personnel
et rêveur&rdquo; in France since La Fontaine. His diction is still very
artificial, the poetic diction of Delille transformed in the direction
of Hugo, but not very much. On the other hand, his descriptive
power in treating of nature shows far more art than the Trianin
school ever attained. His love of the woodland and his political
fervour often remind us of Shelley, and his delicate perception of
Hellenic beauty, and the perfume of Greek legend, give us
almost a foretaste of Keats. For these reasons, among others,
Chénier, whose art is destined to so many vicissitudes of criticism
in his own country, seems assured among English readers of a
place among the Dii Majores of French poetry.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Chénier literature of late years has become enormous. His
fate has been commemorated in numerous plays, pictures and poems,
notably in the fine epilogue of Sully Prudhomme, the <i>Stello</i> of A. de
Vigny, the delicate statue by Puech in the Luxembourg, and the
well-known portrait in the centre of the &ldquo;Last Days of the Terror.&rdquo;
The best editions are still those of Becq de Fouquières (Paris, 1862,
1872 and 1881), though these are now supplemented by those of
L. Moland (2 vols., 1889) and R. Guillard (2 vols., 1899).</p></div>

<p><span class="bold">CHÉNIER, MARIE-JOSEPH BLAISE DE<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (1764-1811), French
poet, dramatist and politician, younger brother of André de
Chénier, was born at Constantinople on the 11th of February
1764.<a name="FnAnchor_1d" id="FnAnchor_1d" href="#Footnote_1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> He was brought up at Carcassonne, and educated in
Paris at the Collège de Navarre. Entering the army at seventeen,
he left it two years afterwards; and at nineteen he produced
<i>Azémire</i>, a two-act drama (acted in 1786), and <i>Edgar, ou le page
supposé</i>, a comedy (acted in 1785), which were failures. His
<i>Charles IX</i> was kept back for nearly two years by the censor.
Chénier attacked the censorship in three pamphlets, and the
commotion aroused by the controversy raised keen interest in
the piece. When it was at last produced on the 4th of November
1789, it achieved an immense success, due in part to its political
suggestion, and in part to Talma&rsquo;s magnificent impersonation of
Charles IX. Camille Desmoulins said that the piece had done
more for the Revolution than the days of October, and a contemporary
memoir-writer, the marquis de Ferrière, says that
the audience came away &ldquo;ivre de vengeance et tourmenté d&rsquo;une
soif de sang.&rdquo; The performance was the occasion of a split among
the actors of the Comédie Française, and the new theatre in the
Palais Royal, established by the dissidents, was inaugurated
with <i>Henri VIII</i> (1791), generally recognized as Chénier&rsquo;s
masterpiece; <i>Jean Calas, ou l&rsquo;école des juges</i> followed in the
same year. In 1792 he produced his <i>Caius Gracchus</i>, which was
even more revolutionary in tone than its predecessors. It was
nevertheless proscribed in the next year at the instance of the
Montagnard deputy Albitte, for an anti-anarchical hemistich
(<i>Des lois et non du sang!</i>); <i>Fénelon</i> (1793) was suspended after
a few representations; and in 1794 his <i>Timoléon</i>, set to Étienne
Méhul&rsquo;s music, was also proscribed. This piece was played
after the fall of the Terror, but the fratricide of Timoléon became
the text for insinuations to the effect that by his silence Joseph
de Chénier had connived at the judicial murder of André, whom
Joseph&rsquo;s enemies alluded to as <i>Abel</i>. There is absolutely nothing
to support the calumny, which has often been repeated since.
In fact, after some fruitless attempts to save his brother, variously
related by his biographers, Joseph became aware that André&rsquo;s
only chance of safety lay in being forgotten by the authorities,
and that ill-advised intervention would only hasten the end.
Joseph Chénier had been a member of the Convention and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
the Council of Five Hundred, and had voted for the death of
Louis XVI.; he had a seat in the tribunate; he belonged to
the committees of public instruction, of general security, and of
public safety. He was, nevertheless, suspected of moderate
sentiments, and before the end of the Terror had become a
marked man. His purely political career ended in 1802, when
he was eliminated with others from the tribunate for his opposition
to Napoleon. In 1801 he was one of the educational jury
for the Seine; from 1803 to 1806 he was inspector-general of
public instruction. He had allowed himself to be reconciled
with Napoleon&rsquo;s government, and <i>Cyrus</i>, represented in 1804,
was written in his honour, but he was temporarily disgraced
in 1806 for his <i>Épître à Voltaire</i>. In 1806 and 1807 he delivered
a course of lectures at the Athénée on the language and literature
of France from the earliest years; and in 1808 at the emperor&rsquo;s
request, he prepared his <i>Tableau historique de l&rsquo;état et du progrès
de la littérature française depuis 1789 jusqu&rsquo;à 1808</i>, a book containing
some good criticism, though marred by the violent
prejudices of its author. He died on the 10th of January 1811.
The list of his works includes hymns and national songs&mdash;among
others, the famous <i>Chant du départ</i>; odes, <i>Sur la mort de
Mirabeau</i>, <i>Sur l&rsquo;oligarchie de Robespierre</i>, &amp;c.; tragedies which
never reached the stage, <i>Brutus et Cassius</i>, <i>Philippe deux</i>,
<i>Tibère</i>; translations from Sophocles and Lessing, from Gray
and Horace, from Tacitus and Aristotle; with elegies, dithyrambics
and Ossianic rhapsodies. As a satirist he possessed
great merit, though he sins from an excess of severity, and is
sometimes malignant and unjust. He is the chief tragic poet
of the revolutionary period, and as Camille Desmoulins expressed
it, he decorated Melpomene with the tricolour cockade.</p>

owes its interest to its chateau (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Architecture</a></span>: <i>Renaissance
Architecture in France</i>), a building in the Renaissance style
on the river Cher, to the left bank of which it is united by a
two-storeyed gallery built upon five arches, and to the right by
a drawbridge flanked by an isolated tower, part of an earlier
building of the 15th century. Founded in 1515 by Thomas
Bohier (d. 1523), financial minister in Normandy, the château
was confiscated by Francis I. in 1535. Henry II. presented
it to his mistress Diane de Poitiers, who on his death was forced
to exchange it for Chaumont-sur-Loire by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici.
The latter built the gallery which leads to the left bank of the
Cher. Chenonceaux passed successively into the hands of
Louise de Vaudémont, wife of Henry III., the house of Vendôme,
and the family of Bourbon-Condé. In the 18th century it came
into the possession of the farmer-general Claude Dupin (1684-1769),
who entertained the most distinguished people in France
within its walls. In 1864 it was sold to the chemist Théophile
Pélouze, whose wife executed extensive restorations. It subsequently

<p><span class="bold">CHEOPS<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span>, in Herodotus, the name of the king who built the
Great Pyramid in Egypt. Following on a period of good rule
and prosperity under Rhampsinitus, Cheops closed the temples,
abolished the sacrifices and made all the Egyptians labour for
his monument, working in relays of 100,000 men every three
months (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pyramid</a></span>). Proceeding from bad to worse, he
sacrificed the honour of his daughter in order to obtain the money
to complete his pyramid; and the princess built herself besides
a small pyramid of the stones given to her by her lovers. Cheops
reigned 50 years and was succeeded by his brother, Chephren,
who reigned 56 years and built the second pyramid. During
these two reigns the Egyptians suffered every kind of misery
and the temples remained closed. Herodotus continues that
in his own day the Egyptians were unwilling to name these
oppressors and preferred to call the pyramids after a shepherd
named Philition, who pastured his flocks in their neighbourhood.
At length Mycerinus, son of Cheops and successor of
Chephren, reopened the temples and, although he built the Third
Pyramid, allowed the oppressed people to return to their proper
occupations.</p>

<p>heops, Chephren and Mycerinus are historical personages
of the fourth Egyptian dynasty, in correct order, and they built
the three pyramids attributed to them here. But they are
wholly misplaced by Herodotus. Rhampsinitus, the predecessor
of Cheops, appears to represent Rameses III. of the twentieth
dynasty, and Mycerinus in Herodotus is but a few generations
before Psammetichus, the founder of the twenty-sixth dynasty.
Manetho correctly places the great Pyramid kings in Dynasty IV.
In Egyptian the name of Cheops (Chemmis or Chembis in Diodorus
Siculus, Suphis in Manetho) is spelt Hwfw (Khufu), but the
pronunciation, in late times perhaps Khöouf, is uncertain.
The Greeks and Romans generally accepted the view that Herodotus
supplies of his character, and moralized on the uselessness
of his stupendous work; but there is nothing else to prove that
the Egyptians themselves execrated his memory. Modern
writers rather dwell on the perfect organization demanded by his
scheme, the training of a nation to combined labour, the level
attained here by art and in the fitting of masonry, and finally
the fact that the Great Pyramid was the oldest of the seven
wonders of the ancient world and now alone of them survives.
It seems that representations of deities, and indeed any representations
at all, were rare upon the polished walls of the great
monuments of the fourth dynasty, and Petrie thinks that he
can trace a violent religious revolution with confiscation of
endowments at this time in the temple remains at Abydos;
but none the less the wants of the deities were then attended to
by priests selected from the royal family and the highest in the
land. Khufu&rsquo;s work in the temple of Bubastis is proved by a
surviving fragment, and he is figured slaying his enemy at Sinai
before the god Thoth. In late times the priests of Denderah
claimed Khufu as a benefactor; he was reputed to have built
temples to the gods near the Great Pyramids and Sphinx (where
also a pyramid of his daughter Hentsen is spoken of), and there
are incidental notices of him in the medical and religious
literature. The funerary cult of Khufu and Khafr&#275; was practised
under the twenty-sixth dynasty, when so much that had fallen
into disuse and been forgotten was revived. Khufu is a leading
figure in an ancient Egyptian story (Papyrus Westcar), but it
is unfortunately incomplete. He was the founder of the fourth
dynasty, and was probably born in Middle Egypt near Beni
Hasan, in a town afterwards known as &ldquo;Khufu&rsquo;s Nurse,&rdquo; but
was connected with the Memphite third dynasty. Two tablets
at the mines of Wadi Maghara in the peninsula of Sinai, a
granite block from Bubastis, and a beautiful ivory statuette
found by Petrie in the temple at Abydos, are almost all that can
be definitely assigned to Khufu outside the pyramid at Giza
and its ruined accompaniments. His date, according to Petrie,
is 3969-3908 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but in the shorter chronology of Meyer,
Breasted and others he reigned (23 years) about a thousand years
later, c. 2900 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

a cliff above the Wye, and covers about 3 acres. The river is
crossed by a fine iron bridge of five arches, erected in 1816, and
by a tubular railway bridge designed by Sir Isambard Brunel.
There is a free passage on the Wye for large vessels as far as the
bridge. From the narrowness and depth of the channel the tide
rises suddenly and to a great height, forming a dangerous bore.
The exports are timber, bark, iron, coal, cider and millstones.
Some shipbuilding is carried on.</p>

<p>As the key to the passage of the Wye, Chepstow (<i>Estrighorel</i>,
<i>Striguil</i>) was the site successively of British, Roman and Saxon
fortifications. Domesday Book records that the Norman castle
was built by William Fitz-Osbern to defend the Roman road
into South Wales. On the confiscation of his son&rsquo;s estates,
the castle was granted to the earls of Pembroke, and after its
reversion to the crown in 1306, Edward II. in 1310 granted it
to his half-brother Thomas de Brotherton. On the latter&rsquo;s
death it passed, through his daughter Margaret, Lady Segrave,
to the dukes of Norfolk, from whom, after again reverting to the
crown, it passed to the earls of Worcester. It was confiscated
by parliament and settled on Oliver Cromwell, but was restored
to the earls in 1660. The borough must have grown up between
1310, when the castle and vill were granted to Thomas de
Brotherton, and 1432, when John duke of Norfolk died seised
of the castle, manor and borough of Struguil. In 1524 Charles,
first earl of Worcester and then lord of the Marches, granted a
new charter of incorporation to the bailiffs and burgesses of the
town, which had fallen into decay. This was sustained until
the reign of Charles II., when, some dispute arising between the
earl of Bridgwater and the burgesses, no bailiff was appointed
and the charter lapsed. Chepstow was afterwards governed by
a board of twelve members. A port since early times, when the
lord took dues of ships going up to the forest of Dean, Chepstow
had no ancient market and no manufactures but that of glass,
which was carried on for a short time within the ruins of the
castle.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEQUE<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span>, or <span class="sc">CHECK</span>, in commercial law, a bill of exchange
drawn on a banker and signed by the drawer, requiring the
banker to pay on demand a certain sum in money to or to the
order of a specified person or to bearer. In this, its most modern
sense, the cheque is the outcome of the growth of the banking
system of the 19th century. For details see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Banks and Banking</a></span>:
<i>Law</i>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bill of Exchange</a></span>. The word check,<a name="FnAnchor_1e" id="FnAnchor_1e" href="#Footnote_1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> of which
&ldquo;cheque&rdquo; is a variant now general in English usage, signified
merely the counterfoil or indent of an exchequer bill, or any
draft form of payment, on which was registered the particulars
of the principal part, as a check to alteration or forgery. The
check or counterfoil parts remained in the hands of the banker,
the portion given to the customer being termed a &ldquo;drawn note&rdquo;
or &ldquo;draft.&rdquo; From the beginning of the 19th century the word
&ldquo;cheque&rdquo; gradually became synonymous with &ldquo;draft&rdquo; as
meaning a written order on a banker by a person having money
in the banker&rsquo;s hands, to pay some amount to bearer or to a
person named. Ultimately, it entirely superseded the word
&ldquo;draft,&rdquo; and has now a statutory definition (Bills of Exchange
Act 1882, s. 73)&mdash;&rdquo; a bill of exchange drawn on a banker payable
on demand.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; has come to have a wider
meaning, that of a bill drawn by one person on another for a sum
of money, or an order (whether on a banker or other) to pay
money. The employment of cheques as a method of payment
offering greater convenience than coin is almost universal in
Great Britain and the United States. Of the transactions
through the banks of the United Kingdom between 86 and 90%
are conducted by means of cheques, and an even higher proportion
in the United States. On the continent of Europe the use
of cheques, formerly rare, is becoming more general, particularly
in France, and to some extent in Germany.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1e" id="Footnote_1e" href="#FnAnchor_1e"><span class="fn">1</span></a> The original meaning of &ldquo;check&rdquo; is a move in the game of chess
which directly attacks the king; the word comes through the Old
Fr. <i>eschec</i>, <i>eschac</i>, from the Med. Lat. form <i>scaccus</i> of the Persian

&ldquo;mate&rdquo; from the Arabic <i>shah-mat</i>, the king is dead. The word was
early used in a transferred sense of a stoppage or rebuff, and so is
applied to anything which stops or hinders a matter in progress, or
which controls or restrains anything, hence a token, ticket or

<p><span class="bold">CHER<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span>, a department of central France, embracing the eastern
part of the ancient province of Berry, and parts of Bourbonnais,
Nivernais and Orléanais, bounded N. by the department of
Loiret, W. by Loir-et-Cher and Indre, S. by Allier and Creuse,
and E. by Nièvre. Pop. (1906) 343,484. Area 2819 sq. m.
The territory of the department is elevated in the south, where
one point reaches 1654 ft., and in the east. The centre is occupied
by a wide calcareous table-land, to the north of which stretches
the plain of Sologne. The principal rivers, besides the Cher and
its tributaries, are the Grande Sauldre and the Petite Sauldre
on the north, but the Loire and Allier, though not falling within
the department, drain the eastern districts, and are available
for navigation. The Cher itself becomes navigable when it
receives the Arnon and Yèvre, and the communications of the
department are greatly facilitated by the Canal du Berry, which
traverses it from east to west, the lateral canal of the Loire,
which follows the left bank of that river, and the canal of the
Sauldre. The climate is temperate, and the rainfall moderate.
Except in the Sologne, the soil is generally fertile, but varies
considerably in different localities. The most productive region
is that on the east, which belongs to the valley of the Loire;
the central districts are tolerably fertile but marshy, being often
flooded by the Cher; while in the south and south-west there
is a considerable extent of dry and fertile land. Wheat and oats
are largely cultivated, while hemp, vegetables and various
fruits are also produced. The vine flourishes chiefly in the east
of the arrondissement of Sancerre. The department contains
a comparatively large extent of pasturage, which has given rise
to a considerable trade in horses, cattle, sheep and wool for the
northern markets. Nearly one-fifth of the whole area consists
of forest. Mines of iron are worked, and various sorts of stone
are quarried. Brick, porcelain and glassworks employ large
numbers of the inhabitants. There are also flour-mills, distilleries,
oil-works, saw-mills and tanneries. Bourges and Vierzon
are metallurgical and engineering centres. Coal and wine are
leading imports, while cereals, timber, wool, fruit and industrial
products are exported. The department is served by the Orléans
railway, and possesses in all more than 300 m. of navigable
waterways. It is divided into three arrondissements (29 cantons,
292 communes) cognominal with the towns of Bourges, Saint-Amand-Mont-Rond,
and Sancerre, of which the first is the
capital, the seat of an archbishop and of a court of appeal and
headquarters of the VIII. army-corps. The department
belongs to the <i>académie</i> (educational division) of Paris. Bourges,
Saint-Amand-Mont-Rond, Vierzon and Sancerre (<i>q.v.</i>) are the
principal towns. Méhun-sur-Yèvre (pop. 5227), a town with an
active manufacture of porcelain, has a Romanesque church and
a château of the 14th century. Among the other interesting
churches of the department, that at St Satur has a fine choir
of the 14th and 15th centuries; those of Dun-sur-Auron,
Plaimpied, Aix d&rsquo;Angillon and Jeanvrin are Romanesque in
style, while Aubigny-Ville has a church of the 12th, 13th and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
15th centuries and a château of later date. Drevant, built on
the site of a Roman town, preserves ruins of a large theatre and
other remains. Among the megalithic monuments of Cher,
the most notable is that at Villeneuve-sur-Cher, known as the
Pierre-de-la-Roche.</p>

of Peshawar. It is situated at an elevation of 4500 ft, on the
west of the Khattak range, which divides the Peshawar from the
Kohat district. It was first used in 1861, and since then has
been employed during the hot weather as a health station for
the British troops quartered in the hot and malarious vale of
Peshawar.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHERBOURG<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span>, a naval station, fortified town and seaport
of north-western France, capital of an arrondissement in the
department of Manche, on the English Channel, 232 m. W.N.W.
of Paris on the Ouest-État railway. Pop. (1906) town, 35,710;
commune, 43,827. Cherbourg is situated at the mouth of the
Divette, on a small bay at the apex of the indentation formed
by the northern shore of the peninsula of Cotentin. Apart from
a fine hospital and the church of La Trinité dating from the
15th century, the town has no buildings of special interest. A
rich collection of paintings is housed in the hôtel de ville. A
statue of the painter J.F. Millet, born near Cherbourg, stands
in the public garden, and there is an equestrian statue of
Napoleon I. in the square named after him. Cherbourg is a
fortified place of the first class, headquarters of one of the five
naval arrondissements of France, and the seat of a sub-prefect.
It has tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a chamber
of commerce, a lycée and a naval school. The chief industries
of the town proper are fishing, saw-milling, tanning, leather-dressing,
ship-building, iron and copper-founding, rope-making
and the manufacture of agricultural implements. There are
stone quarries in the environs, and the town has trade in farm
produce.</p>

<p>Cherbourg derives its chief importance from its naval and
commercial harbours, which are distant from each other about
half a mile. The former consists of three main basins cut out
of the rock, and has an area of 55 acres. The minimum depth
of water is 30 ft. Connected with the harbour are dry docks,
the yards where the largest ships in the French navy are constructed,
magazines, rope walks, and the various workshops
requisite for a naval arsenal of the first class. The works and
town are carefully guarded on every side by redoubts and
fortifications, and are commanded by batteries on the surrounding
hills. There is a large naval hospital close to the harbour.
The commerical harbour at the mouth of the Divette communicates
with the sea by a channel 650 yds. long. It consists
of two parts, an outer and tidal harbour 17&frac12; acres in extent, and
an inner basin 15 acres in extent, with a depth on sill at ordinary
spring tide of 25 ft. Outside these harbours is the triangular
bay, which forms the roadstead of Cherbourg. The bay is
admirably sheltered by the land on every side but the north. On
that side it is sheltered by a huge breakwater, over 2 m. in length,
with a width of 650 ft. at its base and 30 ft. at its summit, which
is protected by forts, and leaves passages for vessels to the east
and west. These passages are guarded by forts placed on islands
intervening between the breakwater and the mainland, and
themselves united to the land by breakwaters. The surface
within these barriers amounts to about 3700 acres. Cherbourg
is a port of call for the American, North German Lloyd and other
important lines of transatlantic steamers. The chief exports
are stone for road-making, butter, eggs and vegetables; the
chief imports are coal, timber, superphosphates and wine from
Algeria. Great Britain is the principal customer.</p>

<p>Cherbourg is supposed by some investigators to occupy the
site of the Roman station of <i>Coriallum</i>, but nothing definite is
known about its origin. The name was long regarded as a
corruption of <i>Caesaris Burgus</i> (Caesar&rsquo;s Borough). William
the Conqueror, under whom it appears as <i>Carusbur</i>, provided
it with a hospital and a church; and Henry II. of England on
several occasions chose it as his residence. In 1295 it was
pillaged by an English fleet from Yarmouth; and in the 14th
century it frequently suffered during the wars against the
English. Captured by the English in 1418 after a four months&rsquo;
siege, it was recovered by Charles VII. of France in 1450. An
attempt was made under Louis XIV. to construct a military port;
but the fortifications were dismantled in 1688, and further
damage was inflicted by the English in 1758. In 1686 Vauban
planned harbour-works which were begun under Louis XVI.
and continued by Napoleon I. It was left, however, to Louis
Philippe, and particularly to Napoleon III., to complete them,
and their successful realization was celebrated in 1858, in the
presence of the queen of England, against whose dominions they
had at one time been mainly directed. At the close of 1857,
£8,000,000, of which the breakwater cost over £2,500,000, had
been expended on the works; in 1889 a further sum of £680,000
was voted by the Chamber of Deputies for the improvement of
the port.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHERBULIEZ, CHARLES VICTOR<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (1829-1899), French
novelist and miscellaneous writer, was born on the 19th of July
1829, at Geneva, where his father, André Cherbuliez (1795-1874),
was a classical professor at the university. He was descended
from a family of Protestant refugees, and many years later
Victor Cherbuliez resumed his French nationality, taking
advantage of an act passed in the early days of the Revolution.
Geneva was the scene of his early education; thence he proceeded
to Paris, and afterwards to the universities of Bonn and Berlin.
He returned to his native town and engaged in the profession of
teaching. After his resumption of French citizenship he was
elected a member of the Academy (1881), and having received
the Legion of Honour in 1870, he was promoted to be officer of
the order in 1892. He died on the 1st of July 1899. Cherbuliez
was a voluminous and successful writer of fiction. His first book,
originally published in 1860, reappeared in 1864 under the title
of <i>Un Cheval de Phidias</i>: it is a romantic study of art in the
golden age of Athens. He went on to produce a series of novels,
of which the following are the best known:&mdash;<i>Le Comte Kostia</i>
(1863), <i>Le Prince Vitale</i> (1864), <i>Le Roman d&rsquo;une honnête femme</i>
(1866), <i>L&rsquo;Aventure de Ladislas Bolski</i> (1869), <i>Miss Ravel</i> (1875),
<i>Samuel Brohl et Cie</i> (1877), <i>L&rsquo;Idée de Jean Teterol</i> (1878), <i>Noirs
et rouges</i> (1881), <i>La Vocation du Comte Ghislain</i> (1888), <i>Une
Gageure</i> (1890), <i>Le Secret du précepteur</i> (1893), <i>Jacquine Vanesse</i>
(1898), &amp;c. Most of these novels first appeared in the <i>Revue des
deux mondes</i>, to which Cherbuliez also contributed a number
of political and learned articles, usually printed with the pseudonym
G. Valbert. Many of these have been published in
collected form under the titles <i>L&rsquo;Allemagne politique</i> (1870),
<i>L&rsquo;Espagne politique</i> (1874), <i>Profils étrangers</i> (1889), <i>L&rsquo;Art et la
nature</i> (1892), &amp;c. The volume <i>Études de littérature et d&rsquo;art</i> (1873)
includes articles for the most part reprinted from <i>Le Temps</i>.
The earlier novels of Cherbuliez have been said with truth to
show marked traces of the influence of George Sand; and in
spite of modification, his method was that of an older school.
He did not possess the sombre power or the intensely analytical
skill of some of his later contemporaries, but his books are
distinguished by a freshness and honesty, fortified by cosmopolitan
knowledge and lightened by unobtrusive humour, which
fully account for their wide popularity in many countries besides
his own. His genius was the reverse of dramatic, and attempts
to present two of his stories on the stage have not succeeded.
His essays have all the merits due to liberal observation and
thoroughness of treatment; their style, like that of the novels,
is admirably lucid and correct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHERCHEL<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span>, a seaport of Algeria, in the arrondissement and
department of Algiers, 55 m. W. of the capital. It is the centre
of an agricultural and vine-growing district, but is commercially
of no great importance, the port, which consists of part only of
the inner port of Roman days, being small and the entry difficult.
The town is chiefly noteworthy for the extensive ruins of former
cities on the same site. Of existing buildings the most remarkable
is the great Mosque of the Hundred Columns, now used as a
military hospital. The mosque contains 89 columns of diorite,
surmounted by a variety of capitals brought from other buildings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
The population of the town in 1906 was 4733; of the commune
of which Cherchel is the centre 11,088.</p>

<p>Cherchel was a city of the Carthaginians, who named it Jol.
Juba II. (25 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) made it the capital of the Mauretanian kingdom
under the name of Caesarea. Juba&rsquo;s tomb, the so-called
Tombeau de la Chrétienne (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Algeria</a></span>), is 7&frac12; m. E. of the town.
Destroyed by the Vandals, Caesarea regained some of its importance
under the Byzantines. Taken by the Arabs it was
renamed by them Cherchel. Khair-ed-Din Barbarossa captured
the city in 1520 and annexed it to his Algerian pashalik. In
the early years of the 18th century it was a commercial city
of some importance, but was laid in ruins by a terrible earthquake
in 1738. In 1840 the town was occupied by the French. The
ruins suffered greatly from vandalism during the early period
of French rule, many portable objects being removed to
museums in Paris or Algiers, and most of the monuments
destroyed for the sake of their stone. Thus the dressed stones
of the ancient theatre served to build barracks; the material
of the hippodrome went to build the church; while the portico
of the hippodrome, supported by granite and marble columns,
and approached by a fine flight of steps, was destroyed by
Cardinal Lavigerie in a search for the tomb of St Marciana. The
fort built by Arouj Barbarossa, elder brother of Khair-ed-Din,
was completely destroyed by the French. There are many
fragments of a white marble temple. The ancient cisterns still
supply the town with water. The museum contains some of
the finest statues discovered in Africa. They include colossal
figures of Aesculapius and Bacchus, and the lower half of a
seated Egyptian divinity in black basalt, bearing the cartouche
of Tethmosis (Thothmes) I. This statue was found at Cherchel,
and is held by some archaeologists to indicate an Egyptian
settlement here about 1500 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

northern foot of the Altyn-tagh, a range of the Kuen-lun, in
85° 35&prime; E., and on the Cherchen-darya, at an altitude of 4100 ft.
It straggles mostly along the irrigation channels that go off from
the left side of the river, and in 1900 had a population of about
2000. The Cherchen-darya, which rises in the Arka-tagh, a more
southerly range of the Kuen-lun, in 87° E. and 36° 20&prime; N., flows
north until it strikes the desert below Cherchen, after which it
turns north-east and meanders through a wide bed (300-400 ft.),
beset with dense reeds and flanked by older channels. It is
probable that anciently it entered the disused channel of the
Ettek-tarim, but at present it joins the existing Tarim in the
lake of Kara-buran, a sort of lacustrine &ldquo;ante-room&rdquo; to the
Kara-koshun (N.M. Przhevalsky&rsquo;s Lop-nor). At its entrance
into the former lake the Cherchen-darya forms a broad delta.
The river is frozen in its lower course for two to three months
in the winter. From the foot of the mountains to the oasis of
Cherchen it has a fall of nearly 4000 ft., whereas in the 300 m.
or so from Cherchen to the Kara-buran the fall is 1400 ft. The
total length is 500-600 m., and the drainage basin measures
6000-7000 sq. m.</p>

isolated groups in the governments of Kazan, Viatka, Novgorod,
Perm, Kostroma and Ufa, eastern Russia. Their name for
themselves is Mori or Mari (people), possibly identifiable with the
ancient Merians of Suzdalia. Their language belongs to the
Finno-Ugrian family. They number some 240,000. There are
two distinct physical types: one of middle height, black-haired,
brown skin and flat-faced; the other short, fair-haired, white
skinned, with narrow eyes and straight short noses. Those
who live on the right bank of the Volga are sometimes known
as Hill Cheremis, and are taller and stronger than those who
inhabit the swamps of the left bank. They are farmers and herd
horses and cattle. Their religion is a hotchpotch of Shamanism,
Mahommedanism and Christianity. They are usually monogamous.
The chief ceremony of marriage is a forcible abduction
of the bride. The women, naturally ugly, are often disfigured
by sore eyes caused by the smoky atmosphere of the huts. They
wear a head-dress, trimmed with glass jewels, forming a hood
behind stiffened with metal. On their breasts they carry a
breastplate formed of coins, small bells and copper disks.</p>

Indies, bounded S. and W. by the Preanger regencies, N.W. by
Krawang, N. by the Java Sea, and E. by the residencies of Tegal
and Banyumas. Pop. (1897) 1,577,521, including 867 Europeans,
21,108 Chinese, and 2016 Arabs and other Asiatic foreigners. The
natives consist of Middle Javanese in the north and Sundanese
in the south. Cheribon has been for many centuries the centre
of Islamism in western Java, and is also the seat of a fanatical
Mahommedan sect controlled from Mecca. The native population
is on the whole orderly and prosperous. The northern half of the
residency is flat and marshy in places, especially in the north-western
corner, while the southern half is mountainous. In the
middle stands the huge volcano Cherimai, clad with virgin
forest and coffee plantations, and surrounded at its foot by rice
fields. South-south-west of Cherimai on the Preanger border is
the Sawal volcano, at whose foot is the beautiful Penjalu lake.
Sulphur and salt springs occur on the slopes of Cherimai, and
near Palimanan there is a cavernous hole called Guwagalang (or
Payagalang), which exhales carbonic acid gas, and is considered
holy by the natives and guarded by priests. There is a similar
hole in the Preanger. The principal products of cultivation are
sugar, coffee, rice and also tea and pulse (<i>rachang</i>), the plantations
being for the most part owned by Europeans. The chief
towns are Cheribon, a seaport and capital of the residency, the
seaport of Indramaya, Palimanan, Majalengka, Kuningan and
Chiamis. Cheribon has a good open roadstead. The town is
very old and irregularly built, and the climate is unhealthy;
nevertheless it has a lively export trade in sugar and coffee and
is a regular port of call. In 1908 the two descendants of the old
sultans of Cheribon still resided there in their respective <i>Kratons</i>
or palaces, and each received an annual income of over £1500 for
the loss of his privileges. A country residence belonging to one
of the sultans is situated close to Cheribon and is much visited
on account of its fantastic architecture. Indramaya was a
considerable trading place in the days of the early Portuguese
and Dutch traders. Kuningan is famous for a breed of small
but strong horses.</p>

south of the Desna the soil is dry and sometimes sandy, and
gradually it assumes the characters of a steppe-land as one
proceeds southward. The government is drained by the Dnieper,
which forms its western boundary for 180 m., and by its tributary
the Desna. The latter, which flows through Chernigov for
nearly 350 m., is navigable, and timber is brought down its
tributaries. The climate is much colder in the wooded tracts
of the north than in the south; the average yearly temperature
at the city of Chernigov is 44.4° F. (January, 23°; July 68.5°).</p>

<p>The population reached 1,996,250 in 1883, 2,316,818 in 1897,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
and 2,746,300 (estimate) in 1906. It is chiefly Little Russian
(85.6%); but Great Russians (6.1%), mostly Raskolniks,
i.e. nonconformists, and White Russians (5.6%) inhabit the
northern districts. There are, besides, some Germans, as well
as Greeks, at Nyezhin. Agriculture is the principal occupation;
in the north, however, many of the inhabitants are engaged in
the timber trade, and in the production of tar, pitch, wooden
wares, leather goods and so forth. Cattle-breeding is carried
on in the central districts. Beet is extensively cultivated. The
cultivation of tobacco is increasing. Hemp is widely grown in
the north, and the milder climate of the south encourages
gardening. Bee-keeping is extensively carried on by the Raskolniks.
Limestone, grindstones, china-clay and building-stone
are quarried. Manufactures have begun to develop rapidly of
late, the most important being sugar-works, distilleries, cloth-mills
and glass-works. The government is divided into fifteen
districts, their chief towns being Chernigov (<i>q.v.</i>), Borzna (pop.
12,458 in 1897), Glukhov (14,856), Gorodnya (4197), Konotop
(23,083), Kozelets (5160), Krolevets (10,375), Mglin (7631),
Novgorod-Syeversk (9185), Novozybkov (15,480), Nyezhin

<p><span class="bold">CHERNIGOV<a name="ar86" id="ar86"></a></span>, a town of Russia, capital of the above government,
on the right bank of the Desna, nearly half a mile
from the river, 141 m. by rail N.E. of Kiev on a branch line.
Pop. (1897) 27,006. It is an archiepiscopal see and possesses a
cathedral of the 11th century. In 907 the city is mentioned
in the treaty of Oleg as next in importance to Kiev, and in the
11th century it became the capital of the principality of Syeversk
and an important commercial city. The Mongol invasion put
an end to its prosperity in 1239. Lithuania annexed it in the
14th century, but it was soon seized by Poland, which held it until
the 17th century. In 1686 it was definitely annexed to Russia.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHEROKEE<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (native <i>Tsalagi</i>, &ldquo;cave people&rdquo;), a tribe of North
American Indians of Iroquoian stock. Next to the Navaho they
are the largest tribe in the United States and live mostly in
Oklahoma (formerly Indian territory). Before their removal
they possessed a large tract of country now distributed among
the states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and the
west of Florida. Their chief divisions were then settled around
the head-waters of the Savannah and Tennessee rivers, and
were distinguished as the Elati Tsalagi or Lower Cherokees,
i.e. those in the plains, and Atali Tsalagi or Upper Cherokees,
i.e. those on the mountains. They were further divided into
seven exogamous clans. Fernando de Soto travelled through
their country in 1540, and during the next three centuries they
were important factors in the history of the south. They
attached themselves to the English in the disputes and contests
which arose between the European colonizers, formally recognized
the English king in 1730, and in 1755 ceded a part of
their territory and permitted the erection of English forts.
Unfortunately this amity was interrupted not long after;
but peace was again restored in 1761. When the revolutionary
war broke out they sided with the royalist party. This led
to their subjugation by the new republic, and they had to
surrender that part of their lands which lay to the south of the
Savannah and east of the Chattahoochee. Peace was made in
1781, and in 1785 they recognized the supremacy of the United
States and were confirmed in their possessions. In 1820 they
adopted a civilized form of government, and in 1827, as a
&ldquo;Nation,&rdquo; a formal constitution. The gradual advance of white
immigration soon led to disputes with the settlers, who desired
their removal, and exodus after exodus took place; a small part
of the tribe agreed (1835) to remove to another district, but
the main body remained. An appeal was made by them to
the United States government; but President Andrew Jackson
refused to interfere. A force of 2000 men, under the command
of General Winfield Scott, was sent in 1838, and the Cherokees
were compelled to emigrate to their present position. After
the settlement various disagreements between the eastern and
western Cherokees continued for some time, but in 1839 a union
was effected. In the Civil War they all at first sided with the
South; but before long a strong party joined the North, and
this led to a disastrous internecine struggle. On the close of the
contest they were confirmed in the possession of their territory,
but were forced to give a portion of their lands to their emancipated
slaves. Their later history is mainly a story of hopeless
struggle to maintain their tribal independence against the white
man. In 1892 they sold their western territory known as the
&ldquo;Cherokee outlet.&rdquo; Until 1906, when tribal government
virtually ceased, the &ldquo;nation&rdquo; had an elected chief, a senate and
house of representatives. Many of them have become Christians,
schools have been established and there is a tribal press. Those
in Oklahoma still number some 26,000, though most are of mixed
blood. A group, known as the Eastern Band, some 1400 strong,
are on a reservation in North Carolina. Their language consists
of two dialects&mdash;a third, that of the &ldquo;Lower&rdquo; branch, having
been lost. The syllabic alphabet invented in 1821 by George
Guess (Sequoyah) is the character employed.</p>

In 1861 it registered a total of 905 in., and its annual average
is 458 in. This excessive rainfall is caused by the fact that
Cherrapunji stands on the edge of the plateau overlooking the

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHERRY<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span>. As a cultivated fruit-tree the cherry is generally
supposed to be of Asiatic origin, whence, according to Pliny, it
was brought to Italy by Lucullus after his defeat of Mithradates,
king of Pontus, 68 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> As with most plants which have been
long and extensively cultivated, it is a matter of difficulty, if not
an impossibility, to identify the parent stock of the numerous
cultivated varieties of cherry; but they are generally referred
to two species: <i>Prunus Cerasus</i>, the wild or dwarf cherry, the
origin of the morello, duke and Kentish cherries, and <i>P. Avium</i>,
the gean, the origin of the geans, hearts and bigarreaus. Both
species grow wild through Europe and western Asia to the
Himalayas, but the dwarf cherry has the more restricted range
of the two in Britain, as it does not occur in Scotland and is rare
in Ireland. The cherries form a section <i>Cerasus</i> of the genus
<i>Prunus</i>; and they have sometimes been separated as a distinct
genus from the plums proper; both have a stone-fruit or drupe,
but the drupe of the cherry differs from that of the plum in not
having a waxy bloom; further, the leaves of the plum are rolled
(<i>convolute</i>) in the bud, while those of the cherry are folded (conduplicate).</p>

<p>The cherries are trees of moderate size and shrubs, having
smooth, serrate leaves and white flowers. They are natives
of the temperate regions of both hemispheres; and the cultivated
varieties ripen their fruit in Norway as far as 63° N. The geans
are generally distinguished from the common cherry by the
greater size of the trees, and the deeper colour and comparative
insipidity of the flesh in the ripe fruit, which adheres firmly
to the &ldquo;nut&rdquo; or stone; but among the very numerous cultivated
varieties specific distinctions shade away so that the fruit
cannot be ranged under these two heads. The leading varieties
are recognized as bigarreaus, dukes, morellos and geans. Several
varieties are cultivated as ornamental trees and on account
of their flowers.</p>

<p>The cherry is a well-flavoured sub-acid fruit, and is much
esteemed for dessert. Some of the varieties are particularly
selected for pies, tarts, &amp;c., and others for the preparation of
preserves, and for making cherry brandy. The fruit is also very
extensively employed in the preparation of the liqueurs known
as kirschwasser, ratafia and maraschino. Kirschwasser is made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
chiefly on the upper Rhine from the wild black gean, and in
the manufacture the entire fruit-flesh and kernels are pulped up
and allowed to ferment. By distillation of the fermented pulp
the liqueur is obtained in a pure, colourless condition. Ratafia
is similarly manufactured, also by preference from a gean.
Maraschino, a highly valued liqueur, the best of which is produced
at Zara in Dalmatia, differs from these in being distilled from
a cherry called marasca, the pulp of which is mixed with honey,
honey or sugar being added to the distillate for sweetening.
It is also said that the flavour is heightened by the use of the
leaves of the perfumed cherry, <i>Prunus Mahaleb</i>, a native of
central and southern Europe.</p>

<p>The wood of the cherry tree is valued by cabinetmakers,
and that of the gean tree is largely used in the manufacture
of tobacco pipes. The American wild cherry, <i>Prunus serotina</i>,
is much sought after, its wood being compact, fine-grained, not
liable to warp, and susceptible of receiving a brilliant polish.
The kernels of the perfumed cherry, <i>P. Mahaleb</i>, are used in
confectionery and for scent. A gum exudes from the stem of
cherry trees similar in its properties to gum arabic.</p>

<p>The cherry is increased by budding on the wild gean, obtained
by sowing the stones of the small black or red wild cherries. To
secure very dwarf trees the <i>Prunus Mahaleb</i> has been used for
the May duke, Kentish, morello and analogous sorts, but it is
not adapted for strong-growing varieties like the bigarreaus.
The stocks are budded, or, more rarely, grafted, at the usual
seasons. The cherry prefers a free, loamy soil, with a well-drained
subsoil. Stiff soils and dry gravelly subsoils are both
unsuitable, though the trees require a large amount of moisture,
particularly the large-leaved sorts, such as the bigarreaus. For
standard trees, the bigarreau section should be planted 30 ft.
apart, or more, in rich soil, and the May duke, morello and
similar varieties 20 or 25 ft. apart; while, as trained trees against
walls and espaliers, from 20 to 24 ft. should be allowed for the
former, and from 15 to 20 ft. for the latter. In forming the stems
of a standard tree the temporary side-shoots should not be
allowed to attain too great a length, and should not be more
than two years old when they are cut close to the stem. The
first three shoots retained to form the head should be shortened
to about 15 in., and two shoots from each encouraged, one at the
end, and the other 3 or 4 in. lower down. When these have
become established, very little pruning will be required, and
that chiefly to keep the principal branches as nearly equal in
strength as possible for the first few years. Espalier trees
should have the branches about a foot apart, starting from the
stem with an upward curve, and then being trained horizontally.
In summer pruning the shoots on the upper branches must be
shortened at least a week before those on the lower ones. After
a year or two clusters of fruit buds will be developed on spurs
along the branches, and those spurs will continue productive
for an indefinite period. For wall trees any form of training
may be adopted; but as the fruit is always finest on young
spurs, fan-training is probably the most advantageous. A
succession of young shoots should be laid in every year. The
morello, which is of twiggy growth and bears on the young wood,
must be trained in the fan form, and care should be taken to
avoid the very common error of crowding its branches.</p>

<p><i>Forcing</i>.&mdash;The cherry will not endure a high temperature nor
close atmosphere. A heat of 45° at night will be sufficient at
starting, this being gradually increased during the first few
weeks to 55°, but lowered again when the blossom buds are about
to open. After stoning the temperature may be again gradually
raised to 60°, and may go up to 70° by day, or 75° by sun heat,
and 60° at night. The best forcing cherries are the May duke
and the royal duke, the duke cherries being of more compact
growth than the bigarreau tribe and generally setting better;
nevertheless a few of the larger kinds, such as bigarreau Napoléon,
black tartarian and St Margaret&rsquo;s, should be forced for variety.
The trees may be either planted out in tolerably rich soil, or
grown in large pots of good turfy friable calcareous loam mixed
with rotten dung. If the plants are small, they may be put into
12-in. pots in the first instance, and after a year shifted into
15-in. pots early in autumn, and plunged in some loose or even
very slightly fermenting material. The soil of the pots should
be protected from snow-showers and cold rains. Occasionally
trees have been taken up in autumn with balls, potted and
forced in the following spring; but those which have been
established a year in the pots are to be preferred. Such only as
are well furnished with blossom-buds should be selected. The
trees should be removed to the forcing house in the beginning
of December, if fruit be required very early in the season. During
the first and second weeks it may be kept nearly close; but, as
vegetation advances, air becomes absolutely necessary during
the day, and even at night when the weather will permit. If
forcing is commenced about the middle or third week of December,
the fruit ought to be ripe by about the end of March. After the
fruit is gathered, the trees should be duly supplied with water
at the root, and the foliage kept well syringed till the wood is
mature. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fruit and Flower Farming</a></span>.)</p>

massacre during the War of Independence. The village was
attacked on the 11th of November 1778 by Walter Butler
(d. 1781) and Joseph Brant with a force of 800 Indians and Tories,
who killed about 50 men, women and children, sacked and
burned most of the houses, and carried off more than 70 prisoners,
who were subjected to the greatest cruelties and privations,

<p><span class="bold">CHERSO<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span>, an island in the Adriatic Sea, off the east coast

Pop. (1900) 8274. It is situated in the Gulf of Quarnero, and is
connected with the island of Lussin, lying on the S.W. by a
turn bridge over the small channel of Ossero, and with the
island of Veglia, lying on the E. by the Canale di Mezzo. These
three are the principal islands of the Quarnero group, and form
together the administrative district of Lussin in the Austrian
crownland of Istria. Cherso is an elongated island about 40 m.
long, 1¼ to 7 m. wide, and has an area of 150 sq. m. It is traversed
by a range of mountains, which attain in the peak of Syss an
altitude of 2090 ft. and form natural terraces, planted with vines
and olive trees, specially in the middle and southern parts of
the island. The northern part is covered with bushes of laurel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
and mastic, but there are scarcely any large trees. There is a
scarcity of springs, and the houses are generally furnished with
cisterns for rain water. In the centre of the island is an interesting
lake called the Vrana or Crow&rsquo;s Lake, situated at an altitude of
40 ft. above, the level of the sea, 3¾ m. long, 1 m. wide and 184

dry, and <span class="grk" title="nêsos">&#957;&#8134;&#963;&#959;&#962;</span>, island), a word equivalent to &ldquo;peninsula.&rdquo;
In ancient geography the Chersonesus Thracica, Chersonesus
Taurica or Scythica, and Chersonesus Cimbrica correspond to
the peninsulas of the Dardanelles, the Crimea and Jutland; and
the Golden Chersonese is usually identified with the peninsula
of Malacca. The Tauric Chersonese was further distinguished
as the Great, in contrast to the Heracleotic or Little Chersonese
at its S.W. corner, where Sevastopol now stands.</p>

<p>The <i>Tauric Chersonese</i><a name="FnAnchor_1f" id="FnAnchor_1f" href="#Footnote_1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (from 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> called
Cherson) was a Dorian colony of Heraclea in Bithynia, founded
in the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> in the Crimea about 2 m. S. of the
modern Sevastopol. After defending itself against the kingdom
of Bosporus (<i>q.v.</i>), and the native Scythians and Tauri, and even
extending its power over the west coast of the peninsula, it
was compelled to call in the aid of Mithradates VI. and his
general Diophantus, c. 110 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and submitted to the Pontic
dynasty. On regaining a nominal independence, it came more
or less under the Roman suzerainty. In the latter part of the
1st century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, and again in the succeeding century, it received
a Roman garrison and suffered much interference in its internal
affairs. In the time of Constantine, in return for assistance
against the Bosporans and the native tribes, it regained its
autonomy and received special privileges. It must, however,
have been subject to the Byzantine authorities, as inscriptions
testify to restorations of its walls by Byzantine officials. Under
Theophilus the central government sent out a governor to take
the place of the elected magistrate. Even so it seems to have
preserved a measure of self-government and may be said to
have been the last of the Greek city states. Its ruin was brought
about by the commercial rivalry of the Genoese, who forbade
the Greeks to trade there and diverted its commerce to Caffa
and Sudak. Previous to this it had been the main emporium
of Byzantine commerce upon the N. coast of the Euxine.
Through it went the communications of the empire with the
Petchenegs and other native tribes, and more especially with
the Russians. The commerce of Cherson is guaranteed in the
early treaties between the Greeks and Russians, and it was in
Cherson, according to Ps. Nestor&rsquo;s chronicle, that Vladimir was
baptized in 988 after he had captured the city. The constitution
of the city was at first democratic under Damiorgi, a senate and
a general assembly. Latterly it appears to have become aristocratic,
and most of the power was concentrated in the hands of
the first archon or Proteuon, who in time was superseded by
the strategus sent out from Byzantium. Its most interesting
political document is the form of oath sworn to by all the citizens
in the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The remains of the city occupy a space about two-thirds of a
mile long by half a mile broad. They are enclosed by a Byzantine
wall. Foundations and considerable remains of a Greek wall
going back to the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> have been found beneath
this in the eastern or original part of the site. Many Byzantine
churches, both cruciform and basilican, have been excavated.
The latter survived here into the 13th century when they had
long been extinct in other Greek-speaking lands. The churches
were adorned with frescoes, wall and floor mosaics, some well
preserved, and marble carvings similar to work found at Ravenna.
The fact that the site has not been inhabited since the 14th
century makes it important for our knowledge of Byzantine
life. The city was used by the Romans as a place of banishment:
St Clement of Rome was exiled hither and first preached the
Gospel; another exile was Justinian II., who is said to have
destroyed the city in revenge. We have a considerable series
of coins from the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> to about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200, and also
some of Byzantine date.</p>

division of Surrey, England, 22 m. W.S.W. from London by
the London &amp; South-Western railway. Pop. of urban district
(1901) 12,762. It is pleasantly situated on the right bank of
the Thames, which is crossed by a bridge of seven arches, built
of Purbeck stone in 1785. The parish church, rebuilt in 1808,
contains a tablet to Charles James Fox, who resided at St
Anne&rsquo;s Hill in the vicinity, and another to Lawrence Tomson, a
translator of the New Testament in the 17th century. Hardly
any remains are left of a great Benedictine abbey, whose buildings
at one time included an area of 4 acres. They fell into almost
complete decay in the 17th century, and a &ldquo;fair house&rdquo; was
erected out of the ruins by Sir Nicholas Carew of Beddington.
The ground-plan can be traced; the fish-ponds are complete;
and carved stones, coffins and encaustic tiles of a peculiar
manufacture are frequently exhumed. Among the abbots the
most famous was John de Rutherwyk, who was appointed in
1307, and continued, till his death in 1346, to carry on a great
system of alteration and extension, which almost made the abbey
a new building. The house in which the poet Cowley spent the
last years of his life remains, and the chamber in which he
died is preserved unaltered. The town is the centre of a large
residential district. Its principal trade is in produce for the
London markets.</p>

<p>The first religious settlement in Surrey, a Benedictine abbey,
was founded in 666 at Chertsey (<i>Cerotesei, Certesey</i>), the manor
of which belonged to the abbot until 1539, since when it has been
a possession of the crown. In the reign of Edward the Confessor
Chertsey was a large village and was made the head of Godley
hundred. The increase of copyhold under Abbot John de
Rutherwyk led to discontent, the tenants in 1381 rising and
burning the rolls. Chertsey owed its importance primarily to
the abbey, but partly to its geographical position. Ferries over
the Redewynd were subjects of royal grant in 1340 and 1399;
the abbot built a new bridge over the Bourne in 1333, and
wholly maintained the bridge over the Thames when it replaced
the 14th century ferry. In 1410 the king gave permission to
build a bridge over the Redewynd. As the centre of an agricultural
district the markets of Chertsey were important and are
still held. Three days&rsquo; fairs were granted to the abbots in 1129
for the feast of St Peter ad Vincula by Henry III. for Holy Rood
day; in 1282 for Ascension day; and a market on Mondays
was obtained in 1282. In 1590 there were many poor, for whose
relief Elizabeth gave a fair for a day in Lent and a market on
Thursdays. These fairs still survive.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHERUBIM<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span>, the Hebrew plural of &ldquo;cherub&rdquo; (<i>k&#283;r&#363;b</i>),
imaginary winged animal figures of a sacred character, referred
to in the description of Solomon&rsquo;s temple (1 Kings vi. 23-35,
vii. 29, viii. 6, 7), and also in that of the ark of the tabernacle
(Ex. xxv. 18-22, xxvi. 1, 31, xxxvii. 7-9). The cherub-images,
where such occur, represent to the imagination the supernatural
bearers of Yahweh&rsquo;s throne or chariot, or the guardians of His
abode; the cherub-carvings at least symbolize His presence,
and communicate some degree of His sanctity. In Gen. iii. 24
the cherubim are the guards of Paradise; Ezek. xxviii. 14, 16
cannot be mentioned here, the text being corrupt. We also find
(1 Sam. iv. 4; 2 Sam. vi. 2) as a divine title &ldquo;that sitteth upon
the cherubim&rdquo;; here it is doubted whether the cherubim are
the material ones in the temple, or those which faith assumes and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
the artist tries to represent&mdash;the supernatural steeds upon which
Yahweh issues forth to interfere in human affairs. In a poetic
theophany (Ps. xviii. 10) we find &ldquo;upon a cherub&rdquo; parallel to
&ldquo;upon the wings of the wind&rdquo; (cp. Isa. xix. 1; Ps. civ. 3).
One naturally infers from this that the &ldquo;cherub&rdquo; was sometimes
viewed as a bird. For the clouds, mythologically, are birds.
&ldquo;The Algonkins say that birds always make the winds, that they
create the waterspouts, and that the clouds are the spreading
and agitation of their wings.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sioux say that the thunder
is the sound of the cloud-bird flapping his wings.&rdquo; If so, Ps. xviii.
10 is a solitary trace of the archaic view of the cherub. The
bird, however, was probably a mythic, extra-natural bird. At
any rate the cherub was suggested by and represents the storm-cloud,
just as the sword in Gen. iii. 24 corresponds to the lightning.
In Ezek. i. the four visionary creatures are expressly connected
with a storm-wind, and a bright cloud (ver. 4). Elsewhere
(xli. 18) the cherub has two faces (a man&rsquo;s and a bird&rsquo;s), but
in i. 10 and x. 14 each cherub has four faces, a view tastefully
simplified in the Johannine Apocalypse (Rev. iv. 7).</p>

<p>It is best, however, to separate Ezekiel from other writers,
since he belongs to what may be called a great mythological
revival. Probably his cherubim are a modification of older
ones, which may well have been of a more sober type. His own
accounts, as we have seen, vary. Probably the cherub has
passed through several phases. There was a mythic bird-cherub,
and then perhaps a winged animal-form, analogous to the winged
figures of bulls and lions with human faces which guarded
Babylonian and Assyrian temples and palaces. Another analogy
is furnished by the winged genii represented as fertilizing the
sacred tree&mdash;the date-palm (Tylor); here the body is human,
though the face is sometimes that of an eagle. It is perhaps even
more noteworthy that figures thought to be cherubs have been
found at Zenjirli, within the ancient North Syrian kingdom of
Ya&rsquo;di (see Jeremias, <i>Das Alte Testament im Lichte des Alten
Orients</i>, pp. 350 f.); we may combine this with the fact that one
of the great gods of this kingdom was called Rakab&rsquo;el or Rek&#363;b&rsquo;el
(also perhaps Rakab or Rek&#363;b). A Sabaean (S. Arabian)
name Karab&rsquo;el also exists. The kerubim might perhaps be
symbolic representatives of the god Rakab&rsquo;el or Rek#363;b&rsquo;el,
probably equivalent to Hadad, whose sacred animal was the bull.
That the figures symbolic of Rakab or Hadad were compounded
or amalgamated by the Israelites with those symbolic of Nergal
(the lion-god) and Ninib (the eagle-god), is not surprising.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHERUBINI, MARIA LUIGI CARLO ZENOBIO SALVATORE<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span>
(1760-1842), Italian musical composer, was born at Florence
on the 14th of September 1760, and died on the 15th of March
1842 in Paris. His father was accompanist (<i>Maestro al Cembalo</i>)
at the Pergola theatre. Cherubini himself, in the preface of his
autograph catalogue of his own works, states, &ldquo;I began to learn
music at six and composition at nine, the former from my father,
the latter from Bartolomeo and Alessandro Felici, and, after
their death, from Bizzarri and J Castrucci.&rdquo; By the time he
was sixteen he had composed a great deal of church music, and
in 1777 he went to Bologna, where for four years he studied under
Sarti. This deservedly famous master well earned the gratitude
which afterwards impelled Cherubini to place one of his double
choruses by the side of his own <i>Et Vitam Venturi</i> as the crown
of his <i>Treatise on Counterpoint and Fugue</i>, though the juxtaposition
is disastrous for Sarti. But besides grounding Cherubini
in the church music for which he had early shown so special a
bent, Sarti also trained him in dramatic composition; sometimes,
like the great masters of painting, entrusting his pupil
with minor parts of his own works. From 1780 onwards for the
next fourteen years dramatic music occupied Cherubini almost
entirely. His first complete opera, <i>Quinto Fabio</i>, was produced
in 1780, and was followed in 1782 by <i>Armida, Adriano in Siria</i>,
and other works. Between 1782 and 1784 the successful production
of five operas in four different towns must have secured
Cherubini a dignified position amongst his Italian contemporaries;
and in 1784 he was invited to London to produce two works for
the Italian opera there, one of which, <i>La Finta Frincipessa</i>, was
favourably received, while the other, <i>Giulio Sabino</i>, was, according
to a contemporary witness, &ldquo;murdered&rdquo; by the critics.</p>

<p>In 1786 he left London for Paris, which became his home after
a visit to Turin in 1787-1788 on the occasion of the production
there of his <i>Ifigenia in Aulide</i>.  With Cherubini, as with some
other composers first trained in a school where the singer reigned
supreme, the influence of the French dramatic sensibility prpved
decisive, and his first French opera, <i>Démophon</i> (1788), though
not a popular success, already marks a departure from the
Italian style, which Cherubini still cultivated in the pieces he
introduced into the works of Anfossi, Paisiello and Cimarosa,
produced by him as director of the Italian opera in Paris (established
in 1789). As in Paris Gluck realized his highest ambitions,
and even Rossini awoke to a final effort of something like dramatic
life in <i>Guillaume Tell</i>, so in Paris Cherubini became a
great composer. If his melodic invention had been as warm as
Gluck&rsquo;s, his immensely superior technique in every branch of
the art would have made him one of the greatest composers that
ever lived. But his personal character shows in quaint exaggeration
the same asceticism that in less sour and more negative
form deprives even his finest music of the glow of that lofty
inspiration that fears nothing.</p>

<p>With <i>Lodoiska</i> (1791) the series of Cherubim&rsquo;s masterpieces
begins, and by the production of <i>Médée</i> (1797) his reputation was
firmly established. The success of this sombre classical tragedy,
which shows Cherubini&rsquo;s genius in its full power, is an honour to
the Paris public. If Cherubini had known how to combine his
high ideals with an urbane tolerance of the opinions of persons of
inferior taste, the severity of his music would not have prevented
his attaining the height of prosperity. But Napoleon Bonaparte
irritated him by an enthusiasm for the kind of Italian music
against which his whole career, from the time he became Sarti&rsquo;s
pupil, was a protest. When Cherubini said to Napoleon, &ldquo;Citoyen
Général, I perceive that you love only that music which does not
prevent you thinking of your politics,&rdquo; he may perhaps have been
as firmly convinced of his own conciliatory manner as he was
when many years afterwards he &ldquo;spared the feelings&rdquo; of a
musical candidate by &ldquo;delicately&rdquo; telling him that he had &ldquo;a
beautiful voice and great musical intelligence, but was too ugly for
a public singer.&rdquo; Napoleon seems to have disliked opposition in
music as in other matters, and the academic offices held by
Cherubini under him were for many years far below his deserts.
But though Napoleon saw no reason to conceal his dislike of
Cherubini, his appointment of Lesueur in 1804 as his chapelmaster
must not be taken as an evidence of his hostility. Lesueur
was not a great genius, but, although recommended for the post
by the retiring chapelmaster, Paesiello (one of Napoleon&rsquo;s
Italian favourites), he was a very meritorious and earnest
Frenchman whom the appointment saved from starvation.
Cherubini&rsquo;s creative genius was never more brilliant than at this
period, as the wonderful two-act ballet, <i>Anacreon</i>, shows; but
his temper and spirits were not improved by a series of disappointments
which culminated in the collapse of his prospects of
congenial success at Vienna, where he went in 1805 in compliance
with an invitation to compose an opera for the Imperial theatre.
Here he produced, under the title of <i>Der Wasserträger</i>, the great
work which, on its first production on the 7th of January 1801
(26 <i>Nivôse, An</i>8) as <i>Les Deux Journées</i>, had thrilled Paris with the
accents of a humanity restored to health and peace. It was
by this time an established favourite in Austria. On the 25th
of February Cherubini produced <i>Faniska</i>, but the war between
Austria and France had broken out immediately after his
arrival, and public interest in artistic matters was checked by
the bombardment and capitulation of Vienna. Though the
meeting between Cherubini and the victorious Napoleon was
not very friendly, he was called upon to direct the music at
Napoleon&rsquo;s soirées at Schönbrunn. But this had not been his
object in coming to Vienna, and he soon returned to a retired
and gloomy life in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span></p>

<p>His stay at Vienna is memorable for his intercourse with
Beethoven, who had a profound admiration for him which he
could neither realize nor reciprocate. It is too much to expect
that the mighty genius of Beethoven, which broke through all
rules in vindication of the principles underlying them, would
be comprehensible to a mind like Cherubini&rsquo;s, in which, while
the creative faculties were finely developed, the critical faculty
was atrophied and its place supplied by a mere disciplinary
code inadequate even as a basis for the analysis of his own
works. On the other hand, it would be impossible to exaggerate
the influence <i>Les Deux Journées</i> had on the lighter parts of
Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Fidelio</i>. Cherubini&rsquo;s librettist was also the author
of the libretto from which <i>Fidelio</i> was adapted, and Cherubini&rsquo;s
score was a constant object of Beethoven&rsquo;s study, not only
before the production of the first version of <i>Fidelio</i>, as <i>Leonore</i>,
but also throughout Beethoven&rsquo;s life. Cherubini&rsquo;s record of
his impressions of Beethoven as a man is contained in the
single phrase, &ldquo;Il était toujours brusque,&rdquo; which at least shows
a fine freedom from self-consciousness on the part of the man
whose only remark on being told of the death of Brod, the famous
oboist, was, &ldquo;Ah, he hadn&rsquo;t much tone&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ah, petit son&rdquo;).
Of the overture to <i>Leonore</i> Cherubini only remarked that he
could not tell what key it was in, and of Beethoven&rsquo;s later
style he observed, &ldquo;It makes me sneeze.&rdquo; Beethoven&rsquo;s brusqueness,
notorious as it was, did not prevent him from assuring
Cherubini that he considered him the greatest composer of the
age and that he loved him and honoured him. In 1806 Haydn
had just sent out his pathetic &ldquo;visiting card&rdquo; announcing that
he was past work; Weber was still sowing wild oats, and Schubert
was only nine years old. We need not, then, be surprised at
Beethoven&rsquo;s judgment. And though we must regret that
Cherubini&rsquo;s disposition prevented him from understanding
Beethoven, it would be by no means true to say that he was
uninfluenced at least by the sheer grandeur of the scale which
Beethoven had by that time established as the permanent
standard for musical art. Grandeur of proportion was, in fact,
eminently characteristic of both composers, and the colossal
structure of such a movement as the duet <i>Perfides ennemis</i> in
<i>Médée</i> is almost inconceivable without the example of Beethoven&rsquo;s
C minor trio, op. 1, No. 3, published two years before it; while
the cavatina <i>Eterno iddio</i> in <i>Faniska</i> is not only worthy of
Beethoven but surprisingly like him in style.</p>

<p>After Cherubini&rsquo;s disappointing visit to Vienna he divided
his time between teaching at the conservatoire and cutting up
playing-cards into figures and landscapes, which he framed and
placed round the walls of his study. Not until 1809 was he
aroused from this morbid indolence. He was staying in retirement
at the country seat of the prince de Chimay, and his
friends begged him to write some music for the consecration of
a church there. After persistent refusals he suddenly surprised
them with a mass in F for three-part chorus and orchestra.
With this work the period of his great church music may be said
to begin; although it was by no means the end of his career
as an opera writer, which, in fact, lasted as late as his seventy-third
year. This third period is also marked by some not unimportant
instrumental compositions. An early event in the
annals of the Philharmonic Society was his invitation to London
in 1815 to produce a symphony, an overture and a vocal piece.
The symphony (in D) was afterwards arranged with a new slow
movement as the string quartet in C (1829), a fact which, taken
in connexion with the large scale of the work, illustrates Cherubini&rsquo;s
deficient sense of style in chamber music. Nevertheless all
the six string quartets written between 1814 and 1837 are
interesting works performed with success at the present day,
though the last three, discovered in 1880, are less satisfactory
than the earlier ones. The requiem in C minor (1817) caused
Beethoven to declare that if he himself ever wrote a requiem
Cherubini&rsquo;s would be his model.</p>

<p>At the eleventh hour Cherubini received recognition from
Napoleon, who, during the Hundred Days, made him chevalier of
the Legion of Honour. Then, with the restoration of the Bourbons,
the very fact that Cherubini had not been <i>persona grata</i>
with Napoleon brought him honour and emoluments. He
was appointed, jointly with Lesueur, as composer and conductor
to the Chapel Royal, and in 1822 he obtained the permanent
directorship of the conservatoire. This brought him into contact,
for the most part unfriendly, with all the most talented
musicians of the younger generation. It is improbable that
Berlioz would have been an easy subject for the wisest and
kindest of spiritual guides; but no influence, repellent or
attractive, could have been more disastrous for that passionate,
quick-witted and yet eminently puzzle-headed mixture of
Philistine and genius, than the crabbed old martinet whose
regulations forbade the students access to Gluck&rsquo;s scores in the
library, and whose only theory of art (as distinguished from his
practice) is accurately formulated in the following passage from
Berlioz&rsquo;s <i>Grande Traité de l&rsquo;instrumentation et d&rsquo;orchestration</i>:
&ldquo;It was no use for the modern composer to say, &lsquo;But do just
listen! See how smoothly this is introduced, how well motived,
how deftly connected with the context, and how splendid it
sounds!&rsquo; He was answered, &lsquo;That is not the point. This
modulation is forbidden; therefore it must not be made.&rsquo;&rdquo;
The lack of really educative teaching, and the actual injustice
for which Cherubini&rsquo;s disciplinary methods were answerable,
did much to weaken Berlioz&rsquo;s at best ill-balanced artistic sense,
and it is highly probable that, but for the kindliness and comparative
wisdom of his composition master, Lesueur, he would
have broken down from sheer lack of any influence which could
command the respect of an excitable youth starving in the
pursuit of a fine art against the violent opposition of his family.
Only when Mendelssohn, at the age of seventeen, visited Paris
in 1825, did Cherubini startle every one by praising a young
composer to his face.</p>

<p>In 1833 Cherubini produced his last work for the stage, <i>Ali
Baba</i>, adapted (with new and noisy features which excited
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s astonished disgust) from a manuscript opera,
<i>Koukourgi</i>, written forty years earlier. It is thus, perhaps, not
a fair illustration of the vigour of his old age; but the requiem
in D minor (for male voices), written in 1836, is one of his greatest
works, and, though not actually his last composition, is a worthy
close to the long career of an artist of high ideals who, while
neither by birth nor temperament a Frenchman, must yet be
counted with a still greater foreigner, Gluck, as the glory of
French classical music. In this he has no parallel except his
friend and contemporary, Méhul, to whom he dedicated <i>Médée</i>,
and who dedicated to him the beautiful Ossianic one-act opera
<i>Uthal</i>. The direct results of his teaching at the conservatoire
were the steady, though not as yet unhealthy, decline of French
opera into a lighter style, under the amiable and modest Boieldieu
and the irresponsible and witty Auber; for, as we have seen,
Cherubini was quite incapable of making his ideals intelligible
by any means more personal than his music; and the crude
grammatical rules which he mistook for the eternal principles
of his own and of all music had not the smallest use as a safeguard
against vulgarity and pretentiousness.</p>

<p>Lest the passage above quoted from Berlioz should be suspected
of bias or irrelevance, we cite a few phrases from Cherubini&rsquo;s
<i>Treatise on Counterpoint and Fugue</i>, of which, though the letter-press
is by his favourite pupil, Halévy, the musical examples
and doctrine are beyond suspicion his own. Concerning the
16th-century idiom, incorrectly but generally known as the
&ldquo;changing note&rdquo; (an idiom which to any musical scholar is as
natural as &ldquo;attraction of the relative&rdquo; is to a Greek scholar),
Cherubini remarks, &ldquo;No tradition gives us any reason why the
classics thus faultily deviated from the rule.&rdquo; Again, he discusses
the use of &ldquo;suspensions&rdquo; in a series of chords which
without them would contain consecutive fifths, and after making
all the observations necessary for the rational conclusion that
the question whether the fifths are successfully disguised or not
depends upon the beauty and force of the suspensions, he merely
remarks that &ldquo;The opinion of the classics appears to me
erroneous, notwithstanding that custom has sanctioned it, for,
on the principle that the discord is a mere suspension of the
chord, it should not affect the nature of the chord. But since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
the classics have pronounced judgment we must of course
submit.&rdquo; In the whole treatise not one example is given from
Palestrina or any other master who handled as a living language
what are now the forms of contrapuntal discipline. As a dead
language Cherubini brought counterpoint up to date by abandoning
the church modes; but in true severity of principle, as
in educational stimulus, his treatise shows a deplorable falling
off from the standard set a hundred years before in Fux&rsquo;s <i>Gradus
ad Panassum</i> with its delightful dialogues between master and
pupil and its continual appeal to artistic experience. Whatever
may have been Cherubini&rsquo;s success in imparting facility and
certainty to his light-hearted pupils who established 19th-century
French opera as a refuge from the terrors of serious art, there
can be no doubt that his career as a teacher did more harm than
good. In it the punishment drill of an incompetent schoolmaster
was invested with the authority of a great composer, and by it
the false antithesis between the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; and the &ldquo;romantic&rdquo;
was erected into a barrier which many critics still find an insuperable
obstacle to the understanding of the classical spirit. And
yet as a composer Cherubini was no pseudo-classic but a really
great artist, whose purity of style, except at rare moments, just
failed to express the ideals he never lost sight of, because in his
love of those ideals there was top much fear.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His principal works are summarized by Fetis as thirty-two operas,
twenty-nine church compositions, four cantatas and several instrumental
pieces, besides the treatise on counterpoint and fugue.</p>

<p>Good modern full scores of the two Requiems and of <i>Les Deux
Journées</i>(the latter unfortunately without the dialogue, which,
however, is accessible in its fairly good German translation in the
<i>Reclam Bibliolhek</i>), and also of ten opera overtures, are current in
the Peters edition. Vocal scores of some of the other operas are not
difficult to get. The great <i>Credo</i> is in the Peters edition, but is
becoming scarce. The string quartets are in Payne&rsquo;s <i>Miniature
Scores.</i>It is very desirable that the operas, from <i>Démophon</i> onwards,
should be republished in full score.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHÉRUEL, PIERRE ADOLPHE<a name="ar99" id="ar99"></a></span> (1800-1891), French historian,
was born at Rouen on the 17th of January 1809. He was
educated at the École Normale Supérieure, and became a fellow
(<i>agrégé</i>) in 1830. His early studies were devoted to his native
town. His <i>Histoire de Rouen sous la domination anglaise au
XVe siecle</i>(1840) and <i>Histoire de Rouen pendant l&rsquo;époque comunale,
1150-1382</i>(Rouen, 1843-1844), are meritorious productions
for a time when the archives were neither inventoried
nor classified, and contain useful documents previously unpublished.
His theses for the degree of doctor, <i>De l&rsquo;administration
de Louis XIV d&rsquo;après les Mémoires inédits d&rsquo;Olivier
d&rsquo;Ormesson</i> and <i>De Maria Stuarta et Henrico III</i>. (1849), led
him to the study of general history. The former was expanded
afterwards under the title <i>Histoire de l&rsquo;administration monarchique
en France depuis l&rsquo;avènement de Philippe-Auguste jusqu&rsquo;à la
mort de Louis XIV</i>(1855), and in 1855 he also published his
<i>Dictionnaire historique des institutions, m&oelig;urs et coutumes de
la France</i>, of which many editions have appeared. These works
may still be consulted for the 17th century, the period upon
which Chéruel concentrated all his scientific activity. He edited
successively the <i>Journal d&rsquo;Olivier Lefèvre d&rsquo;Ormesson</i>(1860-1862),
interesting for the history of the parlement of Paris during the
minority of Louis XIV.; <i>Lettres du cardinal Mazarin pendant
son ministère</i> (6 vols., 1870-1891), continued by the vicomte
G. d&rsquo;Avenel; and <i>Memoires du duc de Saint-Simon,</i> published
for the first time according to the original MSS. (2 editions,
1856-1858 and 1878-1881). To Saint-Simon also he devoted
two critical studies, which are acute but not definitive: <i>Saint-Simon
considéré comme historien de Louis XIV</i> (1865) and
<i>Notice sur la vie et sur les mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon</i>(1876).
The latter may be considered as an introduction to the famous
<i>Mémoires</i>. Among his later writings may be mentioned the
<i>Histoire de la France pendant la minorité de Louis XIV</i> (4 vols.,
1880) and <i>Histoire de la France sous le ministère de Mazarin</i>
(3 vols., 1882-1883). These two works are valuable for abundance
of facts, precision of details, and clear and intelligent
arrangement, but are characterized by a slightly frigid style.
In their compilation Chéruel used a fair number of unpublished
documents. To the student of the second half of the 17th century
in France the works of Chéruel are a mine of information. He
died in Paris on the 1st of May 1891.</p>

St Thomas&rsquo;s hospital (London), becoming full surgeon in the
following year, and he was also chosen one of the surgeons to
St George&rsquo;s hospital on its foundation in 1733. He retired from
St Thomas&rsquo;s in 1738, and died at Bath on the 10th of April
1752. Cheselden is famous for his &ldquo;lateral operation for the
stone,&rdquo; which he first performed in 1727. He also effected a
great advance in ophthalmic surgery by his operation of iridectomy,
described in 1728, for the treatment of certain forms of
blindness by the production of an &ldquo;artificial pupil.&rdquo; He attended
Sir Isaac Newton in his last illness, and was an intimate
friend of Alexander Pope and of Sir Hans Sloane.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESHAM<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span>, a market town in the Aylesbury parliamentary
division of Buckinghamshire, England, 26 m. W.N.W. of London
by the Metropolitan railway. Pop. of urban district (1901)
7245. It is pleasantly situated in the narrow valley of the river
Chess, closely flanked by low wooded hills. The church of St
Mary is cruciform and mainly Perpendicular. Some ancient
frescoes and numerous monuments are preserved. All sorts of
small dairy utensils, chairs, malt-shovels, &amp;c., are made of
beech, the growth of which forms a feature of the surrounding
country. Shoemaking is also carried on. In Waterside hamlet,
adjoining the town, are flour-mills, duck farms, and some of the
extensive watercress beds for which the Chess is noted, as it is
also for its trout-fishing.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHESHIRE<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span>, a north-western county of England, bounded N.
by Lancashire, N.E. by Yorkshire and Derbyshire, S.E. by
Staffordshire, S. by Shropshire, W. by Denbighshire and Flint,
and N.W. by the Irish Sea. Its area is 1027.8 sq. m. The
coast-line is formed by the estuaries of the Dee and the Mersey,
which are separated by the low rectangular peninsula of Wirral.
The estuary of the Dee is dry at low tide on the Cheshire shore,
but that of the Mersey bears upon its banks the ports of Liverpool
(in Lancashire) and Birkenhead (on the Wirral shore). The
Dee forms a great part of the county boundary with Denbighshire
and Flint, and the Mersey the boundary along the whole
of the northern side. The principal river within the county is
the Weaver, which crosses it with a north-westerly course, and,
being joined by the Dane at Northwich, discharges into the
estuary of the Mersey south of Runcorn. The surface of Cheshire
is mostly low and gently undulating or flat; but the broken
line of the Peckforton hills, seldom exceeding 600 ft. in height,
runs north and south flanking the valley of the Weaver on the
west. A low narrow gap in these hills is traversed by the small
river Gowy, which rises to the east but has the greater part of
its course to the west of them. Commanding this gap on the
west, the Norman castle of Beeston stands on an isolated
eminence. The northern part of the hills coincides approximately
with the district still called Delamere Forest, formerly
a chase of the earls of Chester, and finally disforested in 1812.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
In certain sequestered parts the forest has not wholly lost its
ancient character. On the east Cheshire includes the western
face of the broad belt of high land which embraces the Peak
district of Derbyshire; these hills rise sharply to the east of
Congleton, Macclesfield and Hyde, reaching a height of about
1800 ft. within Cheshire. Distributed over the county, but
principally in the eastern half, are many small lakes or meres,
such as Combermere, Tatton, Rostherne, Tabley, Doddington,
Marbury and Mere, and it was a common practice among the
gentry of the county to build their mansions on the banks of
these waters. The meres form one of the most picturesque
features of the county.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;With the exception of a small area of Carboniferous
rocks on the eastern border, and a small patch of Lower Lias near
Audlem, the whole country is occupied by Triassic strata. The
great central plain is covered by red and mottled Keuper Marls.
From these marls salt is obtained; there are many beds of rock-salt,
mostly thin; two are much thicker than the others, being from
75 ft. to over 100 ft. thick. Thin beds and veins of gypsum are
common in the marls. The striking features of the Peckforton Hills
are due to the repeated faulting of the Lower Keuper Sandstone,
which lies upon beds of Bunter Sandstone. Besides forming this
well-marked ridge, the Lower Keuper Sandstones or &ldquo;Waterstones&rdquo;
form several ridges north-west of Macclesfield and appear along
most of the northern borders of the county and in the neighbourhood
of New Brighton and Birkenhead. The Lower Keuper Sandstone is
quarried near the last-named place, also at Storeton, Delamere and
Manley. This is a good building stone and an important water-bearing
stratum; it is often ripple-marked, and bears the footprints
of the <i>Cheirotherium</i>. At Alderley Edge ores of copper, lead and
cobalt are found. West of the Peckforton ridge, Bunter Sandstones
and pebble beds extend to the border. They also form low foothills
between Cheadle and Macclesfield. They fringe the northern boundary
and appear on the south-eastern boundary as a narrow strip
of hilly ground near Woore. The oldest rock exposed in the county
is the small faulted anticline of Carboniferous limestone at Astbury,
followed in regular succession eastward by the shale, and thin
limestones and sandstones of the Pendleside series. These rocks
extend from Congleton Edge to near Macclesfield, where the outcrop
bends sharply eastward and runs up the Goyt valley. Some hard
quartzites in the Pendleside series, known locally as &ldquo;Crowstones,&rdquo;
have contributed to the formation of the high Bosley Min and neighbouring
hills. East of Bosley Min, on either side of the Goyt valley,
are the Millstone Grits and Shales, forming the elevated moorland
tracts. Cloud Hill, a striking feature near Congleton, is capped by
the &ldquo;Third Grit,&rdquo; one of the Millstone Grit series. From Macclesfield
northward through Stockport is a narrow tongue of Lower and
Middle Coal-Measures&mdash;an extension of the Lancashire coalfield.
Coal is mined at Neston in the Wirral peninsula from beneath the
Trias; it is a connecting link between the Lancashire and Flintshire
coalfields. Glacial drift is thickly spread over all the lower ground;
laminated red clays, stiff clay with northern erratics and lenticular
sand masses with occasional gravels, are the common types. At
Crewe the drift is over 400 ft. thick. Patches of Drift sand, with
marine shells, occur on the high ground east of Macclesfield at an
elevation of 1250 ft.</p></div>

<p><i>Agriculture and Industries.</i>&mdash;The climate is temperate and
rather damp; the soil is varied and irregular, but a large proportion
is a thin-skinned clay. More than four-fifths of the total
area is under cultivation. The crop of wheat is comparatively
insignificant; but a large quantity of oats is grown, and a great
proportion of the cultivated land is in permanent pasture. The
vicinity of such populous centres as Liverpool and Manchester, as
well as the several large towns within the county, makes cattle
and dairy-farming profitable. Cheese of excellent quality is
produced, the name of the county being given to a particular
brand (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dairy</a></span>). Potatoes are by far the most important
green crop. Fruit-growing is carried on in some parts, especially
the cultivation of stone fruit and, among these, damsons; while
the strawberry beds near Farndon and Holt are celebrated. In
the first half of the 19th century the condition of agriculture
in Cheshire was notoriously backward; and in 1865-1866 the
county suffered with especial severity from a visitation of cattle
plague. The total loss of stock amounted to more than 66,000
head, and it was necessary to obtain from the Treasury a loan of
£270,000 on the security of the county rate, for purposes of
relief and compensation. The cheese-making industry naturally
received a severe blow, yet to agriculture at large an ultimate
good resulted as the possibility and even the necessity of new
methods were borne in upon the farmers.</p>

<p>The industries of the county are various and important. The
manufacture of cotton goods extends from its seat in Lancashire
into Cheshire, at the town of Stockport and elsewhere in the
north-east. Macclesfield and Congleton are centres of silk
manufacture. At Crewe are situated the great workshops of the
London &amp; North-Western railway company, the institution of
which actually brought the town in to being. Another instance of
the modern creation of a town by an individual industrial
corporation is seen in Port Sunlight on the Mersey, where the
soap-works of Messrs Lever are situated. On the Mersey there
are shipbuilding yards, and machinery and iron works. Other
important manufactures are those of tools, chemicals, clothing
and hats, and there are printing, bleaching and dye works, and
metal foundries. Much sandstone is quarried, but the mineral
wealth of the county lies in coal and salt. The second is a
specially important product. Some rock-salt is obtained at
Northwich and Winsford, but most of the salt is extracted from
brine both here and at Lawton, Wheelock and Middlewich. At
Northwich and other places in the locality curious accidents
frequently occur owing to the sinking of the soil after the brine is
pumped out; walls crack and collapse, and houses are seen
leaning far out of the perpendicular. A little copper and lead
are found.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The county is well served with railways.
The main line of the London &amp; North-Western railway, passing
north from Crewe to Warrington in Lancashire, serves no large
town, but from Crewe branches diverge fanwise to Manchester,
Chester, North Wales and Shrewsbury. The Great Western
railway, with a line coming northward from Wrexham, obtains
access through Cheshire to Liverpool and Manchester. These two
companies jointly work the Birkenhead railway from Chester
to Birkenhead. The heart of the county is traversed by the
Cheshire Lines, serving the salt district, and reaching Chester
from Manchester by way of Delamere Forest. In the east the
Midland and Great Central systems enter the county, and the
North Staffordshire line serves Macclesfield. The Manchester,
South Junction &amp; Altrincham and the Wirral railways are small
systems serving the localities indicated by their names. The
river Weaver is locked as far up as Winsford, and the transport of
salt is thus expedited. The profits of the navigation, which was
originally undertaken in 1720 by a few Cheshire squires, belong
to the county, and are paid annually to the relief of the county
rates. In the salt district through which the Weaver passes
subsidence of the land has resulted in the formation of lakes of
considerable extent, which act as reservoirs to supply the
navigation. There are further means of inland navigation by the
Grand Trunk, Shropshire Union and other canals, and many
small steamers are in use. The Manchester Ship Canal passes
through a section of north Cheshire, being entered from the
estuary of the Mersey by locks near Eastham, and following its
southern shore up to Runcorn, after which it takes a more direct
course than the river.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The ancient county, which is
a county palatine, has an area of 657,783 acres, with a population
in 1891 of 730,058 and in 1901 of 815,099. Cheshire has been
described as a suburb of Liverpool, Manchester and the Potteries
of Staffordshire, and many of those whose business lies in these
centres have colonized such districts as Bowdon, Alderley, Sale
and Marple near Manchester, the Wirral, and Alsager on the
Staffordshire border, until these localities have come to resemble
the richer suburban districts of London. On the short seacoast of
the Wirral are found the popular resorts of New Brighton and
Hoylake. This movement and importance of its industries have
given the county a vast increase of population in modern times.
In 1871 the population was 561,201; from 1801 until that year it
had increased 191%. The area of the administrative county is
654,825 acres. The county contains 7 hundreds. The municipal
boroughs are Birkenhead (pop. 110,915), Chester (38,309),
Congleton (10,707), Crewe (42,074), Dukinfield (18,929), Hyde
(32,766), Macclesfield (34,624), Stalybridge (27,673), Stockport
(92,832). Chester, the county town, is a city, county of a city, and
county borough, and Birkenhead and Stockport are county
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
boroughs. The other urban districts with their populations are

<p>The county is in the North Wales and Chester circuit, and
assizes are held at Chester. It has one court of quarter sessions,
and is divided into fourteen petty sessional divisions. The
boroughs already named, excepting Dukinfield, have separate
commissions of the peace, and Birkenhead and Chester have
separate courts of quarter sessions. There are 464 civil parishes.
Cheshire is almost wholly in the diocese of Chester, but small
parts are in those of Manchester, St Asaph or Lichfield. There
are 268 ecclesiastical parishes or districts wholly or in part
within the county. There are eight parliamentary divisions,
namely, Macclesfield, Crewe, Eddisbury, Wirral, Knutsford,
Altrincham, Hyde and Northwich, each returning one member;
the county also includes the parliamentary borough of Birkenhead
returning one member, and parts of the borough of Stockport,
which returns two members, and of Ashton-under-Lyne, Chester,
Stalybridge, and Warrington, which return one member
each.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The earliest recorded historical fact relating to the
district which is now Cheshire is the capture of Chester and
destruction of the native Britons by the Northumbrian king
Æthelfrith about 614. After a period of incessant strife between
the Britons and their Saxon invaders the district was subjugated
by Ecgbert in 830 and incorporated in the kingdom of Mercia.
During the 9th century. Æthelwulf held his parliament at Chester,
and received the homage of his tributary kings from Berwick to
Kent, and in the 10th century Æthelflæd rebuilt the city, and
erected fortresses at Eddisbury and Runcorn. Edward the
Elder garrisoned Thelwall and strengthened the passages of the
Mersey and the Irwell. On the splitting up of Mercia in the
10th century the dependent districts along the Dee were made a
shire for the fortress of Chester. The shire is first mentioned in
the Abingdon <i>Chronicle</i>, which relates that in 980 Cheshire was
plundered by a fleet of Northmen. At the time of the Domesday
Survey the county was divided into twelve hundreds, exclusive
of the six hundreds between the Ribble and the Mersey, now
included in Lancashire, but then a part of Cheshire. These
divisions have suffered great modification, both in extent and
in name, and of the seven modern hundreds Bucklow alone
retains its Domesday appellation. The hundreds of Atiscross
and Exestan have been transferred to the counties of Flint and
Denbigh, with the exception of a few townships now in the
hundred of Broxton. The prolonged resistance of Cheshire to
the Conqueror was punished by ruthless harrying and sweeping
confiscations of property, and no Englishman retained estates
of importance after the Conquest. In order that the shire
might be relieved of all obligations beyond the ever-pressing
necessity of defending its borders against the inroads of hostile
neighbours, it was constituted a county palatine which the earl
of Chester &ldquo;held as freely by his sword as the king held England
by his crown.&rdquo; The County had its independent parliament
consisting of the barons and clergy, and courts, and all lands
except those of the bishop were held of the earl. The court of
exchequer was presided over by a chamberlain, a
vice-chamberlain, and a baron of the exchequer.
It was principally a court of revenue, but probably
a court of justice also, before that of the
justiciary was established, and had besides the
functions of a chancery court, with an exclusive
jurisdiction in equity. Other officers of the
palatinate were the constable, high-steward and
the Serjeants of the peace and of the forests.
The abbots of St Werburgh and Combermere
and all the eight barons held courts, in any of
which cases of capital felony might be tried.</p>

<p>During the 12th and 13th centuries the county
was impoverished by the constant inroads of the
Welsh. In 1264 the castle and city of Chester
were granted to Simon de Montfort, and in 1267
the treaty of Shrewsbury procured a short interval of peace.
Richard II., in return for the loyal support furnished him by
the county, made it a principality, but the act was revoked in
the next reign. In 1403 Cheshire was the headquarters of
Hotspur, who roused the people by telling them that Richard
II. was still living. At the beginning of the Wars of the Roses
Margaret collected a body of supporters from among the Cheshire
gentry, and Lancastrian risings occurred as late as 1464. At
the time of the Civil War feeling was so equally divided that
an attempt was made to form an association for preserving
internal peace. In 1643, however, Chester was made the headquarters
of the royalist forces, while Nantwich was garrisoned
for the parliament, and the county became the scene of constant
skirmishes until the surrender of Chester in 1646 put an
end to the struggle.</p>

<p>From the number of great families with which it has been
associated Chester has been named &ldquo;the mother and nurse of
English gentility.&rdquo; Of the eight baronies of the earldom none
survives, but the title of that of Kinderton was bestowed in 1762
on George Venables-Vernon, son of Anne, sister of Peter Venables,
last baron of Kinderton, from whom the present Lord Vernon
of Kinderton is descended. Other great Domesday proprietors
were William FitzNigel, baron of Halton, ancestor of the Lacys;
Hugh de Mara, baron of Montalt, ancestor of the Ardens;
Ranulph, ancestor of the Mainwarings; and Hamo de Massey.
The Davenports, Leighs and Warburtons trace their descent
back to the 12th century, and the Grosvenors are descended
from a nephew of Hugh Lupus.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII. the distinctive privileges of
Cheshire as a county palatine were considerably abridged. The
right of sanctuary attached to the city of Chester was abolished;
justices of the peace were appointed as in other parts of the
kingdom, and in 1542 it was enacted that in future two knights
for the shire and two burgesses for the city of Chester should be
returned to parliament. After the Reform Act of 1832 the
county returned four members from two divisions, and Macclesfield
and Stpckport returned two members each. Birkenhead
secured representation in 1859. From 1868 until the Redistribution
Act of 1885 the county returned six members from three
divisions.</p>

<p>From earliest times the staple products of Cheshire have been
salt and cheese. The salt-pits of Nantwich, Middlewich and
Northwich were in active operation at the time of Edward the
Confessor, and at that date the mills and fisheries on the Dee
also furnished a valuable source of revenue. Twelfth century
writers refer to the excellence of Cheshire cheese, and at the
time of the Civil War three hundred tons at £33 per ton were
ordered in one year for the troops in Scotland. The trades of
tanners, skinners and glove-makers existed at the time of
the Conquest, and the export trade in wool in the 13th and
14th centuries was considerable. The first bed of rock-salt
was discovered in 1670. Weaving and wool-combing were
introduced in 1674.</p>

<p><i>Antiquities.</i>&mdash;The main interest in the architecture of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
county lies in the direction of domestic buildings rather than
ecclesiastical. Old half-timbered houses are common in almost
every part of the county; many of these add to the picturesqueness
of the streets in the older towns, as in the case of the famous
Rows in Chester, while in the country many ancient manor-houses
remain as farm-houses. Among the finest examples
are Bramhall Hall, between Stockport and Macclesfield, and
Moreton Old Hall, near Congleton (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">House</a></span>, Plate IV., fig. 13).
The first, occupying three sides of a quadrangle (formerly
completed by a fourth side), dates from the 13th and 14th
centuries, and contains a splendid panelled hall and other rooms.
Of Moreton Hall, which is moated, only three sides similarly
remain; its date is of the 16th century. Other buildings of the
Elizabethan period are not infrequent, such as Brereton and
Dorfold Halls, while more modern mansions, set in fine estates,
are numerous. Crewe Hall is a modern building on an ancient
site, and Vale Royal near Winsford incorporates fragments of a
Cistercian monastery founded in 1277. A noteworthy instance
of the half-timbered style applied to an ecclesiastical building
is found in the church of Lower Peover near Knutsford, of which
only the tower is of stone. The church dates from the 13th
century, and was carefully restored in 1852. Cheshire has no
monastic remains of importance, save those attached to the
cathedral of Chester, nor are its village churches as a rule of
special interest. There is, however, a fine late Perpendicular
church (with earlier portions) at Astbury near Congleton, and
of this style and the Decorated the churches of Bunbury and
Malpas may be noticed as good illustrations. In Chester, besides
the cathedral, there is the massive Norman church of St John;
and St Michael&rsquo;s church and the Rivers chapel at Macclesfield
are noteworthy. No more remarkable religious monuments
remain in the county than the two sculptured Saxon crosses in
the market-place at Sandbach. Ruins of two Norman castles
exist in Beeston and Halton.</p>

(1901) 12,292. The church of St Mary is Perpendicular and
has been enlarged in modern times. A college was founded,
for the education of young men to the ministry of the Connexion,
by Selina countess of Huntingdon in 1768 at Trevecca-isaf near
Talgarth, Brecknockshire. In 1792 it was moved to Cheshunt,
and became known as Cheshunt College. In 1904, as it was
felt that the college was unable properly to carry on its work
under existing conditions, it was proposed to amalgamate it
with Hackney College, but the Board of Education refused to
sanction any arrangement which would set aside the requirements
of the deed of foundation, namely that the officers and
students of Cheshunt College should subscribe the fifteen articles
appended to the deed, and should take certain other obligations.
In 1905 it was decided by the board to reorganize the college
and remove it to Cambridge.</p>

<p>Nursery and market gardening, largely under glass, brick-making
and saw-mills are the chief industries of Cheshunt.
Roman coins and other remains have been found at this place,
and an urn appears built into the wall of an inn. A Romano-British
village or small town is indicated. There was a Benedictine
nunnery here in the 13th century. Of several interesting
mansions in the vicinity one, the Great House, belonged to
Cardinal Wolsey, and a former Pengelly House was the residence
of Richard Cromwell the Protector after his resignation. Theobalds
Park was built in the 18th century, but the original
mansion was acquired by William Cecil, Lord Burghley, in
1561; being taken in 1607 by James I. from Robert Cecil, first
earl of Salisbury, in exchange for Hatfield House. James died
here in 1625, and Charles I. set out from here for Nottingham in
1642 at the outset of the Civil War. One of the entrances to
Theobalds Park is the old Temple Bar, removed from Fleet
Street, London, in 1878.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESNELONG, PIERRE CHARLES<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (1820-1894), French
politician, was born at Orthez in the department of the Basses-Pyrénées,
on the 14th of April 1820. In 1848 he proclaimed
himself a Republican; but after the establishment of the Second
Empire he changed his views, and in 1865 was returned to the
chamber as the official candidate for his native place. He at
once became conspicuous, both for his eloquence and for his
uncompromising clericalism, especially in urging the necessity
for maintaining the temporal power of the papacy. In 1869 he
was again returned, and, devoting himself with exceptional
ability to financial questions, was in 1870 appointed to report
the budget. During and after the war, for which he voted, he
retired for a while into private life; but in 1872 he was again
elected deputy, this time as a Legitimist, and took his seat
among the extreme Right. He was the soul of the reactionary
opposition that led to the fall of Thiers; and in 1873 it was he
who, with Lucien Brun, carried to the comte de Chambord the
proposals of the chambers. Through some misunderstanding,
he reported on his return that the count had accepted all the
terms offered, including the retention of the tricolour flag; and
the count published a formal denial. Chesnelong now devoted
himself to the establishment of Catholic universities and to the
formation of Catholic working-men&rsquo;s clubs. In 1876 he was
again returned for Orthez, but was unseated, and then beaten
by the republican candidate. On the 24th of November, however,
he was elected to a seat in the senate, where he continued
his vigorous polemic against the progressive attempts of the
republican government to secularize the educational system of
France until his death in 1894.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESNEY, CHARLES CORNWALLIS<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1826-1876), British
soldier and military writer, the third son of Charles Cornwallis
Chesney, captain on the retired list of the Bengal Artillery, and
nephew of General F.R. Chesney, was born in Co. Down, Ireland,
on the 29th of September 1826. Educated at Blundell&rsquo;s school,
Tiverton, and afterwards at the Royal Military Academy,
Woolwich, he obtained his first commission as second lieutenant
of engineers in 1845, passing out of the academy at the head of
his term. His early service was spent in the ordinary course
of regimental duty at home and abroad, and he was stationed
in New Zealand during the Crimean War. Among the various
reforms in the British military system which followed from that
war was the impetus given to military education; and in 1858
Captain Chesney was appointed professor of military history
at Sandhurst. In 1864 he succeeded Colonel (afterwards Sir
Edward) Hamley in the corresponding chair at the Staff College.
The writings of these two brilliant officers had a great influence
not only at home, but on the continent and in America. Chesney&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
first published work (1863) was an account of the Civil War in
Virginia, which went through several editions. But the work
which attained the greatest reputation was his <i>Waterloo Lectures</i>
(1868), prepared from the notes of lectures orally delivered at
the Staff College. Up to that time the English literature on the
Waterloo campaign, although voluminous, was made up of
personal reminiscences or of formal records, useful materials
for history rather than history itself; and the French accounts
had mainly taken the form of fiction. In Chesney&rsquo;s lucid and
vigorous account of the momentous struggle, while it illustrates
both the strategy and tactics which culminated in the final
catastrophe, the mistakes committed by Napoleon are laid bare,
and for the first time an English Writer is found to point out that
the dispositions of Wellington were far from faultless. And in
the <i>Waterloo Lectures</i> the Prussians are for the first time credited
by an English pen with their proper share in the victory. The
work attracted much attention abroad as well as at home, and
French and German translations were published.</p>

<p>Chesney was for many years a constant contributor to the
newspaper press and to periodic literature, devoting himself
for the most part to the critical treatment of military operations,
and professional subjects generally. Some of his essays on
military biography, contributed mainly to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
were afterwards published separately (1874). In 1868 he was
appointed a member of the royal commission on military education,
under the presidency first of Earl De Grey and afterwards
of Lord Dufferin, to whose recommendations were due the
improved organization of the military colleges, and the development
of military education in the principal military stations
of the British army. In 1871, on the conclusion of the Franco-German
War, he was sent on a special mission to France and
Germany, and furnished to the government a series of valuable
reports on the different siege operations which had been carried
out during the war, especially the two sieges of Paris. These
reports were published in a large volume, which was issued
confidentially. Never seeking regimental or staff preferment,
Colonel Chesney never obtained any, but he held at the time of
his death a unique position in the army, altogether apart from
and above his actual place in it. He was consulted by officers
of all grades on professional matters, and few have done more
to raise the intellectual standard of the British officer. Constantly
engaged in literary pursuits, he was nevertheless laborious
and exemplary in the discharge of his public duties, while
managing also to devote a large part of his time to charitable
and religious offices. He was abstemious to a fault; and,
overwork of mind and body telling at last on a frail constitution,
he died after a short illness on the 19th of March 1876. He had
become lieutenant-colonel in 1873, and at the time of his death
he was commanding Royal Engineer of the London district.
He was buried at Sandhurst.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESNEY, FRANCIS RAWDON<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (1789-1872), British general
and explorer, was the son of Captain Alexander Chesney, an
Irishman of Scottish descent who, having emigrated to South
Carolina in 1772, did brilliant service under Lord Rawdon
(afterwards marquess of Hastings) in the War of Independence,
and subsequently received an appointment as coast officer at
Annalong, Co. Down, Ireland. There F.R. Chesney was born
on the 16th of March 1789. Lord Rawdon gave the boy a cadetship
at Woolwich, and he was gazetted to the Royal Artillery
in 1805. But though he rose to be lieutenant-general and
colonel-commandant of the 14th brigade Royal Artillery (1864),
and general in 1868, Chesney&rsquo;s memory lives not for his military
record, but for his connexion with the Suez Canal, and with the
exploration of the Euphrates valley, which started with his being
sent out to Constantinople in the course of his military duties
in 1829, and his making a tour of inspection in Egypt and Syria.
His report in 1830 on the feasibility of making the Suez Canal
was the original basis of Lesseps&rsquo; great undertaking (in 1869
Lesseps greeted him in Paris as the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of the canal);
and in 1831 he introduced to the home government the idea of
opening a new overland route to India, by a daring and adventurous
journey (for the Arabs were hostile and he was ignorant
of the language) along the Euphrates valley from Anah to the
Persian Gulf. Returning home, Colonel Chesney (as he then
was) busied himself to get support for the latter project, to
which the East India Company&rsquo;s board was favourable; and
in 1835 he was sent out in command of a small expedition, for
which parliament voted £20,000, in order to test the navigability
of the Euphrates. After encountering immense difficulties, from
the opposition of the Egyptian pasha, and from the need of
transporting two steamers (one of which was lost) in sections
from the Mediterranean over the hilly country to the river,
they successfully arrived by water at Bushire in the summer of
1836, and proved Chesney&rsquo;s view to be a practicable one. In
the middle of 1837 he returned to England, and was given the
Royal Geographical Society&rsquo;s gold medal, having meanwhile
been to India to consult the authorities there; but the preparation
of his two volumes on the expedition (published in 1850) was
interrupted by his being ordered out in 1843 to command the
artillery at Hong Kong. In 1847 his period of service was
completed, and he went home to Ireland, to a life of retirement;
but both in 1856 and again in 1862 he went out to the East to
take a part in further surveys and negotiations for the Euphrates
valley railway scheme, which, however, the government would
not take up, in spite of a favourable report from the House of
Commons committee in 1871. In 1868 he published a further
volume of narrative on his Euphrates expedition. He died on
the 30th of January 1872.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESNEY, SIR GEORGE TOMKYNS<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (1830-1895), English
general, brother of Colonel C.C. Chesney, was born at Tiverton,
Devonshire, on the 30th of April 1830. Educated at Blundell&rsquo;s
school, Tiverton, and at Addiscombe, he entered the Bengal
Engineers as second lieutenant in 1848. He was employed for
some years in the public works department and, on the outbreak
of the Indian Mutiny in 1857, joined the Ambala column, was
field engineer at the battle of Badli-ke-serai, brigade-major of
engineers throughout the siege of Delhi, and was severely
wounded in the assault (medal and clasp and a brevet majority).
In 1860 he was appointed head of a new department in connexion
with the public works accounts. His work on <i>Indian Polity</i>
(1868), dealing with the administration of the several departments
of the Indian government, attracted wide attention and remains
a permanent text-book. The originator of the Royal Indian
Civil Engineering College at Cooper&rsquo;s Hill, Staines, he was also
its first president (1871-1880). In 1871 he contributed to
<i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, &ldquo;The Battle of Dorking,&rdquo; a vivid
account of a supposed invasion of England by the Germans
after their victory over France. This was republished in many
editions and translations, and produced a profound impression.
He was promoted lieutenant-colonel, 1869; colonel, 1877;
major-general, 1886; lieutenant-general, 1887; colonel-commandant
of Royal Engineers, 1890; and general, 1892. From
1881 to 1886 he was secretary to the military department of
the government of India, and was made a C.S.I, and a C.I.E.
From 1886 to 1892, as military member of the governor-general&rsquo;s
council, he carried out many much-needed military reforms.
He was made a C.B. at the jubilee of 1887, and a K.C.B. on
leaving India in 1892. In that year he was returned to parliament,
in the Conservative interest, as member for Oxford, and
was chairman of the committee of service members of the House
of Commons until his death on the 31st of March 1895. He wrote
some novels, <i>The Dilemma</i>, <i>The Private Secretary</i>, <i>The Lesters</i>,
&amp;c., and was a frequent contributor to periodical literature.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESS<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span>, once known as &ldquo;checker,&rdquo; a game played with certain
&ldquo;pieces&rdquo; on a special &ldquo;board&rdquo; described below. It takes its
name from the Persian word <i>shah</i>, a king, the name of one of the
pieces or men used in the game. Chess is the most cosmopolitan
of all games, invented in the East (see <i>History</i>, below), introduced
into the West and now domiciled in every part of the
world. As a mere pastime chess is easily learnt, and a very
moderate amount of study enables a man to become a fair player,
but the higher ranges of chess-skill are only attained by persistent
labour. The real proficient or &ldquo;master&rdquo; not merely must know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
the subtle variations in which the game abounds, but must be able
to apply his knowledge in the face of the enemy and to call to his
aid, as occasion demands, all that he has of foresight, brilliancy
and resource, both in attack and in defence. Two chess players
fighting over the board may fitly be compared to two famous
generals encountering each other on the battlefield, the strategy
and the tactics being not dissimilar in spirit.</p>

<p><i>The Board, Pieces and Moves.</i>&mdash;The chessboard is divided
(see accompanying diagrams) into sixty-four chequered squares.
In diagram 1, the pieces, or chess-men, are arranged for the
beginning of a game, while diagram 2 shows the denomination of
the squares according to the English and German systems of
notation. Under diagram 1 are the names of the various &ldquo;pieces&rdquo;&mdash;each
side, White or Black, having a King, a Queen, two Rooks
(or Castles), two Knights, and two Bishops. The eight men in
front are called Pawns. At the beginning of the game the queen
always stands upon a square of her own colour. The board is so
set that each player has a white square at the right hand end of
the row nearest to him. The rook, knight and bishop on the right
of the king are known as King&rsquo;s rook, King&rsquo;s knight, and King&rsquo;s
bishop; the other three as Queen&rsquo;s rook, Queen&rsquo;s knight, and
Queen&rsquo;s bishop.</p>

<p>Briefly described, the powers of the various pieces and of the
pawns are as follows.</p>

<p>The king may move in any direction, only one square at a time,
except in castling. Two kings can never be on adjacent squares.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: left; width: 300px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figleft1"><img style="width:250px; height:299px" src="images/img94a.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Diagram</span> 1.&mdash;Showing the arrangement of the pieces at
the commencement of a game.</td></tr></table>

<p>The queen moves in any direction
square or diagonal, whether
forward or backward. There is
no limit to her range over vacant
squares; an opponent she may
take; a piece of her own colour
stops her. She is the most powerful
piece on the board, for her
action is a union of those of the
rook and bishop. The rooks (from
the Indian <i>rukh</i> and Persian <i>rokh</i>,
meaning a soldier or warrior)
move in straight lines&mdash;forward
or backward&mdash;but they cannot
move, diagonally. Their range is
like the queen&rsquo;s, unlimited, with
the same exceptions.</p>

<p>The bishops move diagonally
in any direction whether backward or forward. They have
an unlimited range, with the same exceptions.</p>

<p>The knights&rsquo; moves are of an absolutely different kind. They
move from one corner of any rectangle of three squares by two to
the opposite corner; thus, in diagram 3, the white knight can
move to the square occupied by the black one, and vice versa, or a
knight could move from C to D, or D to C. The move may be
made in any direction. It is no obstacle to the knight&rsquo;s move if
squares A and B are occupied. It will be perceived that the
knight always moves to a square of a different colour.</p>

<p>The king, queen, rooks and bishops may capture any foeman
which stands anywhere within their respective ranges; and the
knights can capture the adverse men which stand upon the
squares to which they can leap. The piece which takes occupies
the square of the piece which is taken, the latter being removed
from the board. The king cannot capture any man which is
protected by another man.</p>

<p>The moves and capturing powers of the pawns are as follows:&mdash;Each
pawn for his first move may advance either one or two
squares straight forward, but afterwards one square only, and
this whether upon starting he exercised his privilege of moving
two squares or not. A pawn can never move backwards. He can
capture only diagonally&mdash;one square to his right or left front. A
pawn moves like a rook, captures like a bishop, but only one
square at a time. When a pawn arrives at an eighth square,
viz. at the extreme limit of the board, he may, at the option of
his owner, be exchanged for any other piece, so that a player
may, <i>e.g.</i>, have two or more queens on the board at once.</p>

<p class="center pt2"><img style="width:500px; height:536px" src="images/img94b.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p class="caption1 center"><span class="sc">Diagram</span> 2.&mdash;Showing English and German Methods of Notation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Check and Checkmate.&rdquo; The king can never be captured, but
when any piece or pawn attacks him, he is said to be &ldquo;in check,&rdquo;
and the fact of his being so attacked should be announced by the
adverse player saying &ldquo;check,&rdquo; whereupon the king must move
from the square he occupies, or be screened from check by the
interposition of one of his own men, or the attacking piece must
be captured. If, however, when the king is in check, none of
these things can be done, it is &ldquo;checkmate&rdquo; (Persian, <i>shah mat</i>,
the king is dead), known generally as &ldquo;mate,&rdquo; whereupon the
game terminates, the player whose king has been thus checkmated
being the loser. When the adversary has only his king
left, it is very easy to checkmate him with only a queen and
king, or only a rook and king. The problem is less easy with
king and two bishops, and still less easy with king, knight and
bishop, in which case the opposing king has to be driven into a
corner square whose colour corresponds with the bishop&rsquo;s, mate
being given with the bishop. A king and two knights cannot
mate. To mate with king and rook the opposing king must be
driven on to one of the four side files and kept there with the
rook on the next file, till it is held by the other king, when the
rook mates.</p>

<p>The pawn gives check in the same way as he captures, viz.
diagonally. One king cannot give check to another, nor may a
king be moved into check.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 120px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:70px; height:102px" src="images/img94c.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption1">Knight&rsquo;s move.</td></tr></table>

<p>&ldquo;Check by discovery&rdquo; is given when a player, by moving one
of his pieces, checks with another of them. &ldquo;Double check&rdquo;
means attacking the king at once with two
pieces&mdash;one of the pieces in this case giving
check by discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perpetual check&rdquo; occurs when one player,
seeing that he cannot win the game, finds the
men so placed that he can give check <i>ad
infinitum</i>, while his adversary cannot possibly
avoid it. The game is then drawn. A game is
also drawn &ldquo;if, before touching a man, the
player whose turn it is to play, claims that the game
be treated as drawn, and proves that the existing position
existed, in the game and at the commencement of his turn of play,
twice at least before the present turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stalemate.&rdquo; When a king is not in check, but his owner has
no move left save such as would place the king in check, it is
&ldquo;stalemate,&rdquo; and the game is drawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Castling.&rdquo; This is a special move permitted to the king once
only in the game. It is performed in combination with either
rook, the king being moved two squares laterally, while the rook
towards which he is moved (which must not have previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
moved from its square) is placed next him on the other side; the
king must be touched first. The king cannot castle after having
been once moved, nor when any piece stands between him and
the rook, nor if he is in check, nor when he has to cross a square
commanded by an adverse piece or pawn, nor into check. It will
be perceived that after castling with the king&rsquo;s rook the latter
will occupy the KB square, while the king stands on the KKt
square, and if with the queen&rsquo;s rook, the latter will occupy the
queen&rsquo;s square while the king stands on the QB square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking <i>en passant</i>.&rdquo; This is a privilege possessed by any
of the pawns under the following circumstances:&mdash;If a pawn,
say of the white colour, stands upon a fifth square, say upon K5
counting from the white side, and a black pawn moves from Q2
or KB2 to Q4 or KB4 counting from the black side, the white
pawn can take the black pawn <i>en passant</i>. For the purposes of
such capture the latter is dealt with as though he had only moved
to Q3 or KB3, and the white pawn taking him diagonally then
occupies the square the captured pawn would have reached had
he moved but one square. The capture can be made only
on the move immediately succeeding that of the pawn to be
captured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drawn Game.&rdquo; This arises from a stalemate (noticed
above), or from either player not having sufficient force wherewith
to effect checkmate, as when there are only two kings
left on the board, or king and bishop against king, or king with
one knight, or two knights against king, or from perpetual
check. One of the players can call upon the other to give checkmate
in fifty moves, the result of failure being that the game is
drawn. But, if a pawn is moved, or a piece is captured, the
counting must begin again.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;minor piece&rdquo; means either a knight or a bishop. &ldquo;Winning
the exchange&rdquo; signifies capturing a rook in exchange for a
minor piece. A &ldquo;passed pawn&rdquo; is one that has no adverse
pawn either in front or on either of the adjoining files. A
&ldquo;file&rdquo; is simply a line of squares extending vertically from
one end of the board to the other. An &ldquo;open file&rdquo; is one on
which no piece or pawn of either colour is standing. A pawn
or piece is <i>en prise</i> when one of the enemy&rsquo;s men can capture it.
&ldquo;Gambit&rdquo; is a word derived from the Ital. <i>gambetto</i>, a tripping
up of the heels; it is a term used to signify an opening in which
a pawn or piece is sacrificed at the opening of a game to obtain
an attack. An &ldquo;opening,&rdquo; or <i>début</i>, is a certain set method
of commencing the game. When a player can only make one
legal move, that move is called a &ldquo;forced move.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Value of the Pieces.</i>&mdash;The relative worth of the chess-men
cannot be definitely stated on account of the increase or decrease
of their powers according to the position of the game and the
pieces, but taking the pawn as the unit the following will be
an estimate near enough for practical purposes:&mdash;pawn 1,
bishop 3.25, knight 3.25, rook 5, queen 9.50. Three minor pieces
may more often than not be advantageously exchanged for the
queen. The knight is generally stronger than the bishop in the
end game, but two bishops are usually stronger than two knights,
more especially in open positions.</p>

<p><i>Laws.</i>&mdash;The laws of chess differ, although not very materially,
in different countries. Various steps have been taken, but as
yet without success, to secure the adoption of a universal code.
In competitions among English players the particular laws to
be observed are specially agreed upon,&mdash;the regulations most
generally adopted being those laid down at length in Staunton&rsquo;s
<i>Chess Praxis</i>, or the modification of the <i>Praxis</i> laws issued in
the name of the British Chess Association in 1862.</p>

<p><i>First Move and Odds.</i>&mdash;To decide who moves first, one player
conceals a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the
other, his adversary not seeing in which hand the different pawns
are put. The other holds out his hands with the pawns concealed,
and his adversary touches one. If that contains the white pawn,
he takes the white men and moves first. If he draws the black
pawn his adversary has the first move, since white, by convention,
always plays first. Subsequently the first move is taken alternately.
If one player, by way of odds, &ldquo;gives&rdquo; his adversary
a pawn or piece, that piece is removed before play begins. If
the odds are &ldquo;pawn and move,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pawn and two,&rdquo; a black
pawn, namely, the king&rsquo;s bishop&rsquo;s pawn, is removed and white
plays one move, or any two moves in succession. &ldquo;Pawn and
two&rdquo; is generally considered to be slightly less in point of odds
than to give a knight or a bishop; to give a knight and a bishop
is to give rather more than a rook; a rook and bishop less than
a queen; two rooks rather more than a queen. The odds of
&ldquo;the marked pawn&rdquo; can only be given to a much weaker player.
A pawn, generally KB&rsquo;s pawn, is marked with a cap of paper.
If the pawn is captured its owner loses the game; he can also
lose by being checkmated in the usual way, but he cannot give
mate to his adversary with any man except the marked pawn,
which may not be moved to an eighth square and exchanged
for a piece.</p>

<p><i>Rules.</i>&mdash;If a player touch one of his men he must move it,
unless he says <i>j&rsquo;adoube</i> (I adjust), or words of a similar meaning,
to the effect that he was only setting it straight on its square.
If he cannot legally move a touched piece, he must move his
king, if he can, but may not castle; if not, there is no penalty.
He must say <i>j&rsquo;adoube</i> before touching his piece. If a player
touch an opponent&rsquo;s piece, he must take it, if he can: if not,
move his king. If he can do neither, no penalty. A move is
completed and cannot be taken back, as soon as a player, having
moved a piece, has taken his hand off it. If a player is called
upon to mate under the fifty-move rule, &ldquo;fifty moves&rdquo; means
fifty moves and the forty-nine replies to them. A pawn that
reaches an eighth square <i>must</i> be exchanged for some other piece,
the move not being complete until this is done; a second king
cannot be selected.</p>

<p><i>Modes of Notation.</i>&mdash;The English and German methods of
describing the moves made in a game are different. According to
the English method each player counts from his own side of
the board, and the moves are denoted by the names of the files
and the numbers of the squares. Thus when a player for his
first move advances the king&rsquo;s pawn two squares, it is described
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;1. P-K4.&rdquo; The following moves, with the aid
of diagram 2, will enable the reader to understand the principles
of the British notation. The symbol x is used to express
&ldquo;takes&rdquo;; a dash&mdash;to express &ldquo;to.&rdquo;</p>

<table class="reg" width="100%" summary="Contents">

<p>It is now usual to express the notation as concisely as possible;
thus, the third moves of White and Black would be given as
3. B-B4, because it is clear that only the fourth square of the
queen&rsquo;s bishop&rsquo;s file is intended.</p>

<p>The French names for the pieces are, King, <i>Roi</i>; Queen, <i>Dame</i>;
Rook, <i>Tour</i>; Knight, <i>Cavalier</i>; Pawn, <i>Pion</i>; for Bishop the
French substitute <i>Fou</i>, a jester. Chess is <i>Les Échecs</i>.</p>

<p>The German notation employs the alphabetical characters
a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h, proceeding from left to right, and the
numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, running upwards, these being
always calculated from the white side of the board (see diagram
2). Thus the White Queen&rsquo;s Rook&rsquo;s square is a1, the White
Queen&rsquo;s square is d1; the Black Queen&rsquo;s square, d8; the
White King&rsquo;s square, e1; the Black King&rsquo;s square, e8, and so
with the other pieces and squares. The German names of the
pieces are as follows:&mdash;King, <i>König</i>; Queen, <i>Dame</i>; Rook,
<i>Turm</i>; Bishop, <i>Läufer</i>; Knight, <i>Springer</i>; Pawn, <i>Bauer</i>;
Chess, <i>Schach</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span></p>

<p>The initials only of the pieces are given, the pawns (<i>Bauern)</i>
being understood. The Germans use the following signs in their
notation, viz.:&mdash;for &ldquo;check&rdquo; (&dagger;); &ldquo;checkmate&rdquo; (&Dagger;); &ldquo;takes&rdquo;
(:); &ldquo;castles on king&rsquo;s side&rdquo; (0-0); &ldquo;castles on queen&rsquo;s side&rdquo;
(0-0-0); for &ldquo;best move&rdquo; a note of admiration (!); for &ldquo;weak
move&rdquo; a note of interrogation (?). The opening moves just given
in the English will now be given in the German notation:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Rice Gambit (so called after its inventor, Prof. Isaac L. Rice
of New York), whether right or not, is only possible if Black plays
7. B - Q3. Paulsen&rsquo;s 7. B - Kt2 is better, and avoids unnecessary
complications. 8. P - Q4 is the usual move. Leaving the knight
<i>en prise</i>, followed by 9. R - K sq, constitutes the Rice Gambit.
The interesting points in the game are that White subjects himself
to a most violent attack with impunity, for in the end Black could
not save the game by 22. P - B8 claiming a second queen with a
discovered check, nor by claiming a knight with double check, as
it is equally harmless to White.</p>

<p>This brilliant game, played at the Munich tournament, 1900,
would be unique had the combinations occurred spontaneously in
the game. As a matter of fact, however, the whole variation had
been elaborated by Maroczy and Halprin previously, on the chance
of Pillsbury adopting the defence in the text. The real merit
belongs to Pillsbury, who had to find the correct defence to an
attack which Halprin had committed to memory and simply had to
be careful to make the moves in regular order.</p>

<p>This game, played in the London tournament, 1883, is one of the
most remarkable productions of modern times, neither surpassed
nor indeed equalled hitherto.</p>

<p><i>End Games.</i>&mdash;A game of chess consists of three branches&mdash;the
opening, the middle and the end game. The <i>openings</i> have
been analysed and are to be acquired by the study of the books
on the subject. The <i>middle game</i> can only be acquired practically.
The combinations being inexhaustible in their variety, individual
ingenuity has its full scope. Those endowed with a fertile
imagination will evolve plans and combinations leading to
favourable issues. The less endowed player, however, is not left
quite defenceless; he has necessarily to adopt a different system,
namely, to try to find a weak point in the arrangement of his
opponent&rsquo;s forces and concentrate his attack on that weak spot.
As a matter of fact, in a contest between players of equal strength,
finding the weak point in the opponent&rsquo;s armour is the only
possible plan, and this may be said to be the fundamental
principle of the modern school. In the good old days the battles
were mostly fought in the neighbourhood of the king, each side
striving for a checkmate. Nowadays the battle may be fought
anywhere. It is quite immaterial where the advantage is gained
be it ever so slight. Correct continuation will necessarily increase
it, and the opponent may be compelled to surrender in the end
game without being checkmated, or a position may be reached
when the enemies, in consequence of the continual fight, are so
reduced that the kings themselves have to take the field&mdash;the
end game. The <i>end game</i>, therefore, requires a special study.
It has its special laws and the value of the pieces undergoes a
considerable change. The kings leave their passive rôle and
become attacking forces. The pawns increase in value, whilst
that of the pieces may diminish in certain cases. Two knights,
for instance, without pawns, become valueless, as no checkmate
can be effected with them. In the majority of cases the players
must be guided by general principles, as the standard examples
do not meet all-cases.</p>

<p>The handbooks as a rule give a sprinkling of elementary endings,
such as to checkmate with queen, rook, bishop and knight,
two bishops, and pawn endings pure and simple, as well as pawns
in connexion with pieces in various forms. Towards the end of
the 19th century a valuable work on end games was published
in England by the late B. Horwitz; thus for the first time a
theoretical classification of the art was given. This was followed
by a more comprehensive work by Professor J. Berger of Gratz,
which was translated a few years later by the late Mr Freeborough.</p>

<p>A few specimens of the less accessible positions are given
below:&mdash;</p>

a position supposed to have occurred in a game of chess, being
none other than the critical point where your antagonist announces
checkmate in a given number of moves, no matter what defence
you play,&rdquo; but the above description conveys no idea of the
degree to which problem-composing has become a specialized
study. Owing its inception, doubtless, to the practice of recording
critical phases from actual play, the art of problem composition
has so grown in favour as to earn the title of the &ldquo;poetry&rdquo; of
the game.</p>

<p style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good chess problem exemplifies chess strategy idealized and
concentrated. In examples of actual play there will necessarily
remain on the board pieces immaterial to the issue (checkmate),
whereas in problems the composer employs only <i>indispensable</i>
force so as to focus attention on the idea, avoiding all material
which would tend to &ldquo;obscure the issue.&rdquo; Hence the first
object in a problem is to extract the maximum of <i>finesse</i> with a
sparing use of the pieces, but &ldquo;economy of force&rdquo; must be
combined with &ldquo;purity of the mate.&rdquo; A very common mistake,
until comparatively recent years, was that of appraising the
&ldquo;economy&rdquo; of a position according to the slenderness of the
force used, but economy is not a question of absolute values. The
true criterion is the ratio of the force employed to the skill
demanded. The earliest composers strove to give their productions
every appearance of real play, and indeed their compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
partook of the nature of ingenious end-games, in which it was
usual to give Black a predominance of force, and to leave the
White king in apparent jeopardy. From this predicament he
was extricated by a series of checking moves, usually involving
a number of brilliant sacrifices. The number of moves was
rarely less than five. In the course of time the solutions were
reduced to shorter limits and the beauty of quiet (non-checking)
moves began to make itself felt. The early transition school, as
it has been called, was the first to recognize the importance of
economy, <i>i.e.</i> the representation of the main strategic point
without any extraneous force. The mode of illustrating
single-theme problems, often of depth and beauty, was being
constantly improved, and the problems of C. Bayer, R. Willmers,
S. Loyd, J.G. Campbell, F. Healey, &ldquo;J.B.&rdquo; of Bridport, and W.
Grimshaw are, of their kind, unsurpassed. In the year 1845 the
&ldquo;Indian&rdquo; problem attracted much notice, and in 1861 appeared
Healey&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Bristol&rdquo; problem. To this period must be
ascribed the discovery of most of those clever ideas which have
been turned to such good account by the later school. In an
article written in 1899 F.M. Teed mentions the fact that his
<i>incomplete</i> collection of &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; totalled over three hundred.</p>

<p>In 1870 or thereabouts, the later transition period, a more
general tendency was manifest to illustrate two or more finished
ideas in a single problem with strict regard to purity and economy,
the theory of the art received greater attention than before and
the essays of C. Schwede, Kohtz and Kockelkorn, Lehner and
Gelbfuss, helped to codify hitherto unwritten rules of taste. The
last quarter of the 19th century, and its last decade especially,
saw a marked advance in technique, until it became a common
thing to find as much deep and quiet play embodied in a single
first-class problem as in three or four of the old-time problems,
and hence arose the practice of blending several distinct ideas in
one elaborate whole.</p>

<p>In the composition of &ldquo;two-movers&rdquo; it is customary to allow
greater elasticity and a less rigorous application of the principles
of purity and economy. By this means a greater superficial
complexity is attained; but the Teutonic and Bohemian schools,
and even English and American two-move specialists, recognize
that complexity, if it involves the sacrifice of first principles, is
liable to abuse. The blind master, A.F. Mackenzie of Jamaica,
however, with a few others (notably T. Taverner, W. Gleave,
H. and E. Bettman and P.F. Blake) have won some of their
greatest successes with problems which, under stricter ruling,
would not be allowed.</p>

<p>Bohemian (Czech) composers have long stood unrivalled as
exponents of that blending of ideas which is the distinguishing
trait of the later problem. Such is their skill in construction
that it is rare to find in a problem of the Bohemian school fewer
than three or four lines of play which, in economy and purity,
are unimpeachable. Amongst the earliest composers of this
class Anton König, the founder of the school, Makovky, Drtina,
Palct and Pilnacek deserve to be honourably mentioned, but it
was not until the starting of a chess column in the weekly journal
<i>Svetozor</i> that the merits of the new school were fully asserted. It
was in 1871 that Jan Dobrusky contributed his first composition
to that paper: he was followed by G. Chocholous, C. Kondelik,
Pospisil, Dr Mazel, Kviciala, Kesl, Tuzar, Musil and J. Kotrc;
and later still, Havel, Traxler and Z. Mach were no unworthy
followers of Dobrusky.</p>

<p>The faculty for blending variations is not without &ldquo;the defects
of its qualities,&rdquo; and consequently among the less able composers
a certain tendency to repeat combinations of similar companion
ideas is discernible at times, while the danger that facile construction
might usurp the place of originality and strategy was
already apparent to Chocholous when, in an article on the
classification of chess problems (<i>Deutsche Schachzeitung</i>, 1890), he
warned the younger practitioners of the Bohemian school against
what has been dubbed by H. Von Gottschall <i>Varianten-leierei</i>,
or &ldquo;the grinding out of variations.&rdquo; When this one reservation
is made few will be inclined to dispute the pre-eminence
of the Bohemian school. To some tastes, however, a greater
appeal is made by the deeper play of the older German school,
the quaint fancy of the American composer Samuel Loyd, or the
severity and freedom from &ldquo;duals&rdquo; which mark the English
composers.</p>

<p>The idea of holding a problem competition open to the world
was first mooted in connexion with the chess congress of 1851,
but it was in 1854 that a tourney (confined to British composers)
was first held. Since then a number of important problem
tournaments have been held.</p>


<p class="center1"><i>History of Chess.</i></p>

<p>The origin of chess is lost in obscurity. Its invention has been
variously ascribed to the Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, Scythians,
Egyptians, Jews, Persians, Chinese, Hindus, Arabians, Araucanians,
Castilians, Irish and Welsh. Some have endeavoured
to fix upon particular individuals as the originators of the game;
amongst others upon Japheth, Shem, King Solomon, the wife of
Ravan, king of Ceylon, the philosopher Xerxes, the Greek chieftain
Palamedes, Hermes, Aristotle, the brothers Lydo and Tyrrhene,
Semiramis, Zenobia, Attalus (d. c. 200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the mandarin Hansing,
the Brahman Sissa and Shatrenscha, stated to be a celebrated
Persian astronomer. Many of these ascriptions are fabulous,
others rest upon little authority, and some of them proceed from
easily traceable errors, as where the Roman games of <i>Ludus
Latrunculorum</i> and <i>Ludus Calculorum</i>, the Welsh recreation of
<i>Tawlbwrdd</i> (throw-board) and the ancient Irish pastime of
<i>Fithcheall</i> are assumed to be identical with chess; so far as the
Romans and Welsh are concerned, the contrary can be proved,
while from what little is known of the Irish game it appears not
to have been a sedentary game at all. The claims of the Chinese
were advocated in a letter addressed by Mr Eyles Irwin in 1793
to the earl Charlemont. This paper was published in the <i>Transactions
of the Royal Irish Academy</i>, and its purport was that chess,
called in the Chinese tongue <i>chong-ki</i> (the &ldquo;royal game&rdquo;) was
invented in the reign of Kao-Tsu, otherwise Lin-Pang, then king,
but afterwards emperor of Kiang-Nang, by a mandarin named
Han-sing, who was in command of an army invading the Shen-Si
country, and who wanted to amuse his soldiers when in winter
quarters. This invasion of the Shen-Si country by Han-Sing took
place about 174 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Capt. Hiram Cox states that the game is
called by the Chinese <i>choke-choo-hong ki</i>, &ldquo;the play of the science
of war.&rdquo; (See also a paper published by the Hon. Daines
Barrington in the 9th vol. of the <i>Archaeologia</i>.) Mr N. Bland,
M.R.A.S., in his <i>Persian Chess</i> (London, 1850), endeavours to
prove that the Persians were the inventors of chess, and maintains
that the game, born in Persia, found a home in India, whence
after a series of ages it was brought back to its birthplace. The
view, however, which has obtained the most credence, is that
which attributes the origin of chess to the Hindus. Dr Thomas
Hyde of Oxford, writing in 1694 (<i>De Ludis Orientalibus</i>), seems
to have been the first to propound this theory, but he appears to
have been ignorant of the game itself, and the Sanskrit records
were not accessible in his time. About 1783-1789 Sir William
Jones, in an essay published in the 2nd vol. of <i>Asiatic Researches</i>,
argued that Hindustan was the cradle of chess, the game having
been known there from time immemorial by the name of <i>chaturanga</i>,
that is, the four <i>angas</i>, or members of an army, which are
said in the <i>Amarakosha</i> to be elephants, horses, chariots and foot
soldiers. As applicable to real armies, the term <i>chaturanga</i> is
frequently used by the epic poets of India. Sir William Jones&rsquo;s essay
is substantially a translation of the <i>Bhawishya Purana</i>, in which
is given a description of a four-handed game of chess played with
dice. A pundit named Rhadhakant informed him that this was
mentioned in the oldest law books, and also that it was invented
by the wife of Ravan, king of Lanka (Ceylon), in the second age
of the world in order to amuse that monarch while Rama was
besieging his metropolis. This account claims for chess an
existence of 4000 or 5000 years. Sir William, however, grounds
his opinions as to the Hindu origin of chess upon the testimony of
the Persians and not upon the above manuscript, while he considers
the game described therein to be more modern than the
Persian game. Though sure that the latter came from India and
was invented there, he admits that he could not find any account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
of it in the classical writings of the Brahmans. He lays it down
that chess, under the Sanskrit name <i>chaturanga</i>, was exported from
India into Persia in the 6th century of our era; that by a natural
corruption the old Persians changed the name into <i>chatrang</i>, but
when their country was soon afterwards taken possession of by the
Arabs, who had neither the initial nor final letter of the word in
their alphabet, they altered it further into <i>shatranj</i>, which name
found its way presently into modern Persian and ultimately into
the dialects of India.</p>

<p>Capt. Hiram Cox, in a letter upon Burmese chess, written in
1799 and published in the 7th vol. of <i>Asiatic Researches</i>, refers to
the above essay, and considers the four-handed game described
in the Sanskrit manuscript to be the most ancient form of chess,
the Burmese and Persian games being second and third in order
of precedence. Later, in the 11th and 24th vols. of the <i>Archaeologia</i>,
Mr Francis Douce and Sir Frederick Madden expressed
themselves in favour of the views held by Hyde and his followers.</p>

<p>In Professor Duncan Forbes&rsquo;s <i>History of Chess</i> (1860) Capt. Cox&rsquo;s
views, as founded upon Sir William Jones&rsquo;s Sanskrit manuscript,
are upheld and are developed into an elaborate theory. Professor
Forbes holds that the four-handed game of <i>chaturanga</i> described
in the <i>Bhawishya Purana</i> was the primeval form of chess; that
it was invented by a people whose language was Sanskrit (the
Hindus); and that it was known and practised in India from a
time lost in the depths of a remote antiquity, but for a period the
duration of which may have been from 3000 to 4000 years before
the 6th century of the Christian era. He endeavours to show, but
adduces no proof, how the four armies commanded by four kings
in Sir William Jones&rsquo;s manuscript became converted into two
opposing armies, and how two of the kings were reduced to a
subordinate position, and became &ldquo;monitors&rdquo; or &ldquo;counsellors,&rdquo;
one standing by the side of the White and the other of the Black
king, these counsellors being the <i>farzins</i> from which we derive our
&ldquo;queens.&rdquo; Among other points he argues, apparently with justice,
that <i>chaturanga</i> was evidently the root of <i>shatranj</i>, the latter word
being a mere exotic in the language of the inhabitants of Persia.</p>

<p>Van der Linde, in his exhaustive work, <i>Geschichte und Litteratur
des Schachspiels</i> (Berlin, 1874), has much to say of the origin-theories,
nearly all of which he treats as so many myths. He
agrees with those who consider that the Persians received the
game from the Hindus; but the elaborate <i>chaturanga</i> theories
of Forbes receive but scant mercy. Van der Linde argues that
<i>chaturanga</i> is always used by the old Indian poets of an army
and never of a game, that all Sanskrit scholars are agreed that
chess is not mentioned in really ancient Hindu records; that the
<i>Puranas</i> generally, though formerly considered to be extremely
old, are held in the light of modern research to reach no farther
back than the 10th century&mdash;while the copies of the <i>Bhawishya
Purana</i> in the British Museum and the Berlin Library do not
contain the extract relied upon by Forbes, though it is to be found
in the <i>Raghunandana</i>, which was translated by Weber in 1872,
and is stated by Bühler to date from the 16th century. The
outcome of van der Linde&rsquo;s studies appears to be that chess certainly
existed in Hindustan in the 8th century, and that probably
that country is the land of its birth. He inclines to the idea that
the game originated among the Buddhists, whose religion was
prevalent in India from the 3rd to the 9th century. According to
their ideas, war and the slaying of one&rsquo;s fellow-men, for any purposes
whatever, is criminal, and the punishment of the warrior
in the next world will be much worse than that of the simple
murderer; hence chess was invented as a substitute for war. In
opposition to Forbes, therefore, and in agreement with Sir William
Jones, van der Linde takes the view that the four-handed game of
the original manuscript is a comparatively modern adaptation of
the Hindu chess, and he altogether denies that there is any proof
that any form of the game has the antiquity attributed to it.
Internal evidence certainly seems to contradict the theory that
Sir William Jones&rsquo;s manuscript is very ancient testimony; for it
mentions two great sages, Vyasa and Gotama, the former as
teaching <i>chaturanga</i> to Prince Yudhishthira, and the other as
giving an opinion upon certain principles of the game; but this
could not well be, seeing that it was played with dice, and that all
games of hazard were positively forbidden by Manu. It would
appear also that Indian manuscripts are not absolutely trustworthy
as evidence of the antiquity of their contents; for the
climate has the effect of destroying such writings in a period of 300
or 400 years. They must, therefore, be recopied from time to time
and in this way later interpolations may easily creep in.</p>

<p>Von der Lasa, who had, in an article prefixed to the <i>Handbuch</i>
in 1864, accepted Forbes&rsquo;s views, withdrew his support in
a review of the work just noticed, published in the September
and November numbers of the <i>Deutsche Schachzeitung</i>, 1874, and
expressed his adherence to the opinions of van der Linde.</p>

<p>Altogether, therefore, we find the best authorities agreeing that
chess existed in India before it is known to have been played
anywhere else. In this supposition they are strengthened by the
names of the game and of some of the pieces. <i>Shatranj</i>, as Forbes
has pointed out, is a foreign word among the Persians and Arabians,
whereas its natural derivation from the term <i>chaturanga</i> is obvious.
Again <i>al-fil</i>, the Arabic name of the bishop, means the elephant,
otherwise <i>alephhind</i>, the Indian ox. Our earliest authority on
chess is Masudi, an Arabic author who wrote about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 950.
According to him, <i>shatranj</i> had existed long before his time; and
though he may speak not only for his own generation but for a
couple of centuries before, that will give to chess an existence of
over a thousand years.</p>

<p><i>Early and Medieval Times.</i>&mdash;The dimness which shrouds the
origin of chess naturally obscures also its early history. We
have seen that chess crossed over from India into Persia, and
became known in the latter country by the name of <i>shatranj</i>.
Some have understood that word to mean &ldquo;the play of the
king&rdquo;; but undoubtedly Sir William Jones&rsquo;s derivation carries
with it the most plausibility. How and when the game was
introduced into Persia we have no means of knowing. The
Persian poet Firdusi, in his historical poem, the <i>Shahnama</i>,
gives an account of the introduction of <i>shatranj</i> into Persia
in the reign of Chosroes I. Anushirwan, to whom came ambassadors
from the sovereign of Hind (India), with a chessboard
and men asking him to solve the secrets of the game, if
he could, or pay tribute. Chosroes I. was the contemporary
of Justinian, and reigned in the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Professor
Forbes seems to think that this poem may be looked upon as
an authentic history. This appears, however, to be somewhat
dangerous, especially as Firdusi lived some 450 years after the
supposed event took place; but since other Persian and Arabian
writers state that <i>shatranj</i> came into Persia from India, there
appears to be a consensus of opinion that may be considered to
settle the question. Thus we have the game passing from the
Hindus to the Persians and thence to the Arabians, after the
capture of Persia by the Caliphs in the 7th century, and from
them, directly or indirectly, to various parts of Europe, at a
time which cannot be definitely fixed, but either in or before the
11th century. That the source of the European game is Arabic
is clear enough, not merely from the words &ldquo;check&rdquo; and &ldquo;mate,&rdquo;
which are evidently from <i>Shah mat</i> (&ldquo;the king is dead&rdquo;), but
also from the names of some of the pieces. There are various
chess legends having reference to the 7th and 8th centuries, but
these may be neglected as historically useless; and equally useless
appear the many oriental and occidental romances which
revolve around those two great central figures, Harun al-Rashid
and Charlemagne. There is no proof that either of them knew
anything of chess or, so far as the latter is concerned, that it had
been introduced into Europe in his time. True, there is an
account given in Gustavus Selenus, taken from various old
chronicles, as to the son of Prince Okar or Otkar of Bavaria
having been killed by a blow on the temple, struck by a son of
Pippin after a game of chess; and there is another well-known
tradition as to the magnificent chess-board and set of men said to
have been sent over as a present by the empress Irene to Charlemagne.
But both tales are not less mythical than the romance
which relates how the great Frankish monarch lost his kingdom
over a game of chess to Guérin de Montglave; for van der Linde
shows that there was no Bavarian prince of the name of Okar or
Otkar at the period alluded to, and as ruthlessly shatters the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
tradition about Irene&rsquo;s chessmen. With respect to Harun
al-Rashid, among the various stories told which connect him with
chess, there is one that at first sight may seem entitled to some
degree of credit. In the annals of the Moslems by Abulfeda (Abu&rsquo;l
Fida), there is given a copy of a letter stated to be &ldquo;From
Nicephorus, emperor of the Romans, to Harun, sovereign of
the Arabs,&rdquo; which (using Professor Forbes&rsquo;s translation) after
the usual compliments runs thus:&mdash;&ldquo;The empress (Irene) into
whose place I have succeeded, looked upon you as a <i>Rukh</i> and
herself as a mere Pawn; therefore she submitted to pay you a
tribute more than the double of which she ought to have exacted
from you. All this has been owing to female weakness and
timidity. Now, however, I insist that you, immediately on
reading this letter, repay to me all the sums of money you ever
received from her. If you hesitate, the sword shall settle our
accounts.&rdquo; Harun&rsquo;s reply, written on the back of the Byzantine
emperor&rsquo;s letter, was terse and to the point. &ldquo;In the name of
God the merciful and gracious. From Harun, the commander
of the faithful, to the Roman dog Nicephorus. I have read thine
epistle, thou son of an infidel mother; my answer to it thou
shalt see, not hear.&rdquo; Harun was as good as his word, for he
marched immediately as far as Heraclea, devastating the Roman
territories with fire and sword, and soon compelled Nicephorus
to sue for peace. Now the points which give authority to this
narrative and the alleged correspondence are that the relations
which they assume between Irene and Nicephorus on the one
hand and the warlike caliph on the other are confirmed by the
history of those times, while, also, the straightforward brevity
of Harun&rsquo;s reply commends itself as what one might expect
from his soldier-like character. Still, the fact must be remembered
that Abulfeda lived about five centuries after the time to
which he refers. Perhaps we may assume that it is not improbable
that the correspondence is genuine; but that the words
<i>rukh</i> and <i>pawn</i> may have been substituted for other terms of
comparison originally used.</p>

<p>As to how chess was introduced into western and central
Europe nothing is really known. The Spaniards very likely
received it from their Moslem conquerors, the Italians not
improbably from the Byzantines, and in either case it would pass
northwards to France, going on thence to Scandinavia and
England. Some say that chess was introduced into Europe at
the time of the Crusades, the theory being that the Christian
warriors learned to play it at Constantinople. This is negatived
by a curious epistle of St Peter Damian, cardinal bishop
of Ostia, to Pope Alexander II., written about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1061, which,
assuming its authenticity, shows that chess was known in Italy
before the date of the first crusade. The cardinal, as it seems,
had imposed a penance upon a bishop whom he had found
diverting himself at chess; and in his letter to the pope he
repeats the language he had held to the erring prelate, viz.
&ldquo;Was it right, I say, and consistent with thy duty, to sport away
thy evenings amidst the vanity of chess, and defile the hand
which offers up the body of the Lord, and the tongue that
mediates between God and man, with the pollution of a sacrilegious
game?&rdquo; Following up the same idea that statutes of the
church of Elna, in the 3rd vol. of the <i>Councils of Spain</i>, say,
&ldquo;Clerks playing at dice or chess shall be <i>ipso facto</i>
excommunicated.&rdquo; Eudes de Sully, bishop of Paris under Philip Augustus,
is stated in the <i>Ordonn. des Rois de France</i> to have forbidden
clerks to play the game, and according to the <i>Hist. Eccles.</i> of
Fleury, St Louis, king of France, imposed a fine on all who
should play it. Ecclesiastical authorities, however, seemed to
have differed among themselves upon the question whether
chess was or was not a lawful game according to the canons, and
Peirino (<i>De Proelat.</i> chap. 1) holds that it was permissible for
ecclesiastics to play thereat. Among those who have taken
an unfavourable view of the game may be mentioned John Huss,
who, when in prison, deplored his having played at chess, whereby
he had lost time and run the risk of being subject to violent
passions. Among authentic records of the game may be quoted
the <i>Alexiad</i> of the princess Anna Comnena, in which she relates
how her father, the emperor Alexius, used to divert his mind
from the cares of state by playing at chess with his relatives.
This emperor died in 1118.</p>

<p>Concerning chess in England there is the usual confusion
between legend and truth. Snorre Sturleson relates that as
Canute was playing at chess with Earl Ulf, a quarrel arose, which
resulted in the upsetting of the board by the latter, with the
further consequence of his being murdered in church a few days
afterwards by Canute&rsquo;s orders. Carlyle, in <i>The Early Kings of
Norway</i>, repeats this tale, but van der Linde treats it as a myth.
The <i>Ramsey Chronicle</i> relates how bishop Utheric, coming to
Canute at night upon urgent business, found the monarch and
his courtiers amusing themselves at dice and chess. There is
nothing intrinsically improbable in this last narrative; but
Canute died about 1035, and the date, therefore, is suspiciously
early. Moreover, allowance must be made for the ease with
which chroniclers described other games as chess. William the
Conqueror, Henry I., John and Edward I. are variously stated
to have played at chess. It is generally supposed that the
English court of exchequer took its name from the cloth, figured
with squares like a chess-board, which covered the table in it
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Exchequer</a></span>). An old writer says that at the coronation
of Richard I. in 1189, six earls and barons carried a chess-board
with the royal insignia to represent the exchequer court. According
to Edmonson&rsquo;s <i>Heraldry</i>, twenty-six English families bore
chess rooks in their coats of arms.</p>

<p>As regards the individual pieces, the king seems to have had
the same move as at present; but it is said he could formerly be
captured. His &ldquo;castling&rdquo; privilege is a European invention;
but he formerly leaped two and even three squares, and also to
his Kt 2nd. Castling dates no farther back than the first half of
the 16th century. The queen has suffered curious changes in
name, sex and power. In <i>shatranj</i> the piece was called <i>farz</i> or
<i>firz</i> (also <i>farzan</i>, <i>farzin</i> and <i>farzi</i>), signifying a &ldquo;counsellor,&rdquo;
&ldquo;minister&rdquo; or &ldquo;general.&rdquo; This was latinized into <i>farzia</i> or
<i>fercia</i>. The French slightly altered the latter form into <i>fierce</i>,
<i>fierge</i>, and as some say, <i>vierge</i>, which, if true, might explain its
becoming a female. Another and much more probable account
has it that whereas formerly a pawn on reaching an eighth square
became a <i>farzin</i>, and not any other piece, which promotion was
of the same kind as at draughts (in French, <i>dames</i>), so she became
a <i>dame</i> or queen as in the latter game, and thence <i>dama</i>, <i>donna</i>,
&amp;c. There are old Latin manuscripts in which the terms <i>ferzia</i>
and <i>regina</i> are used indifferently. The queen formerly moved
only one square diagonally and was consequently the weakest
piece on the board. The immense power she now possesses
seems to have been conferred upon her so late as about the middle
of the 15th century. It will be noticed that under the old
system the queens could never meet each other, for they operated
on diagonals of different colours. The bishop&rsquo;s scope of action
was also very limited formerly; he could only move two squares
diagonally, and had no power over the intermediate square,
which he could leap over whether it was occupied or not. This
limitation of their powers prevailed in Europe until the 15th
century. This piece, according to Forbes, was called among the
Persians <i>pil</i>, an elephant, but the Arabs, not having the letter
<i>p</i> in their alphabet, wrote it <i>fil</i>, or with their definite article
<i>al-fil</i>, whence <i>alphilus</i>, <i>alfinus</i>, <i>alifiere</i>, the latter being the word
used by the Italians; while the French perhaps get their <i>fol</i>
and <i>fou</i> from the same source. The pawns formerly could move
only one square at starting; their powers in this respect were
increased about the early part of the 16th century. It was
customary for them on arriving at an eighth square to be exchanged
only for a <i>farzin</i> (queen), and not any other piece;
the rooks (so called from the Indian <i>rukh</i> and Persian <i>rokh</i>,
meaning &ldquo;a soldier&rdquo;) and the knights appear to have always
had the same powers as at present. As to the chessboards, they
were formerly uncoloured, and it is not until the 13th century
that we hear of checkered boards being used in Europe.</p>

<p><i>Development in Play.</i>&mdash;The change of <i>shatranj</i> into modern
chess took place most probably first in France, and thence made
its way into Spain early in the 15th century, where the new game
was called <i>Axedrez de la dama</i>, being also adopted by the Italians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
under the name of <i>scacci alla rabiosa</i>. The time of the first important
writer on modern chess, the Spaniard Ruy Lopez de Segura
(1561), is also the period when the latest improvement, castling,
was introduced, for his book (<i>Libra de la invention liberal y arte
del juego del Axedrez</i>), though treating of it as already in use,
also gives the old mode of play, which allowed the king a leap
of two or three squares. Shortly afterwards the old <i>shatranj</i>
disappears altogether. Lopez was the first who merits the name
of chess analyst. At this time flourished the flower of the Spanish
and Italian schools of chess&mdash;the former represented by Lopez,
Ceron, Santa Maria, Busnardo and Avalos; the latter by
Giovanni Leonardo da Cutri (il Puttino) and Paolo Boi (il
Syracusano). In the years 1562-1575 both Italian masters
visited Spain and defeated their Spanish antagonists. During
the whole 17th century we find but one worthy to be mentioned,
Giacchino Greco (il Calabrese). The middle of the 18th century
inaugurates a new era in chess. The leading man of this time
was François André Danican Philidor. He was born in 1726
and was trained by M. de Kermur, Sire de Légal, the star of
the <i>Cafe de la Régence</i> in Paris, which has been the centre of
French chess ever since the commencement of the 18th century.
In 1747 Philidor visited England, and defeated the Arabian
player, Phillip Stamma, by 8 games to 1 and 1 draw. In 1749
he published his <i>Analyse des échecs</i>, a book which went through
more editions and was more translated than any other work
upon the game. During more than half a century Philidor
travelled much, but never went to Italy, the only country where
he could have found opponents of first-rate skill. Italy was
represented in Philidor&rsquo;s time by Ercole del Rio, Lolli and
Ponziani. Their style was less sound than that of Philidor,
but certainly a much finer and in principle a better one. As
an analyst the Frenchman was in many points refuted by
Ercole del Rio (&ldquo;the anonymous Modenese&rdquo;). Blindfold
chess-play, already exhibited in the 11th century by Arabian
and Persian experts, was taken up afresh by Philidor, who
played on many occasions three games simultaneously without
sight of board or men. These exhibitions were given in London,
at the Chess Club in St James&rsquo;s Street, and Philidor died in that
city in 1795. As eminent players of this period must be mentioned
Count Ph.J. van Zuylen van Nyevelt (1743-1826),
and the German player, J. Allgaier (1763-1823). after whom a
well-known brilliant variation of the King&rsquo;s Gambit is named.
Philidor was succeeded by Alexandre Louis Honoré Lebreton
Deschapelles (1780-1847), who was also a famous whist player.
The only player who is known to have fought Deschapelles not
unsuccessfully on even terms is John Cochrane. He also lost
a match (1821) to W. Lewis, to whom he conceded the odds of
&ldquo;pawn and move,&rdquo; the Englishman winning one and drawing the
two others. Deschapelles&rsquo; greatest pupil, and the strongest player
France ever possessed, was Louis Charles Mahé de la Bourdonnais,
who was born in 1797 and died in 1840. His most memorable
achievement was his contest with the English champion,
Alexander Macdonnell, the French player winning in the proportion
of three to two.</p>

<p>The English school of chess began about the beginning of the
19th century, and Sarratt was its first leader. He flourished from
1808 to 1821, and was followed by his great pupil, W. Lewis,
who will be principally remembered for his writings. His
literary career belongs to the period from 1818 to 1848 and he
died in 1869. A. Macdonnell (1798-1835) has been already
mentioned. To the same period belong also Captain Evans,
the inventor of the celebrated &ldquo;Evans Gambit&rdquo; (1828), who
died at a very advanced age in 1873; Perigal, who participated
in the correspondence matches against Edinburgh and Paris;
George Walker, for thirty years chess editor of <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life in
London</i>; and John Cochrane, who met every strong player from
Deschapelles downwards. In the same period Germany possessed
but one good player, J. Mendheim of Berlin. The fifth decade
of the 19th century is marked by the fact that the leadership
passed from the French school to the English. After the death
of la Bourdonnais, Fournié de Saint-Amant became the leading
player in France; he visited England in the early part of 1843,
and successfully met the best English players, including Howard
Staunton (<i>q.v.</i>); but the latter soon took his revenge, for in
November and December 1843 a great match between Staunton
and Saint-Amant took place in Paris, the English champion
winning by 11 games to 6 with 4 draws. During the succeeding
eight years Staunton maintained his reputation by defeating
Popert, Horwitz and Harrwitz. Staunton was defeated by
Anderssen at the London tournament in 1851, and this concluded
his match-playing career. Among the contemporaries of
Staunton may be mentioned Henry Thomas Buckle, author
of the <i>History of Civilization</i>, who defeated Kieseritzki, Anderssen
and Löwenthal.</p>

<p>In the ten years 1830-1840 a new school arose in Berlin, the
seven leaders of which have been called &ldquo;The Pleiades.&rdquo; These
were Bledow (1795-1846), Bilguer (1815-1840), Hanstein (1810-1850),
Mayet (1810-1868), Schorn (1802-1850), B. Horwitz
(b. 1809) and von Heydebrandt und der Lasa, once German
ambassador at Copenhagen. As belonging to the same period
must be mentioned the three Hungarian players, Grimm, Szen
and J. Löwenthal.</p>

<p>Among the great masters since the middle of the 19th century
Paul Morphy (1837-1884), an American, has seldom been surpassed
as a chess player. His career was short but brilliant.
Born in New Orleans in 1837, he was taught chess by his father
when only ten years of age, and in two years&rsquo; time became a strong
player. When not quite thirteen he played three games with
Löwenthal, and won two of them, the other being drawn. He
was twenty years of age when he competed in the New York
congress of 1857, where he won the first prize. In 1858 he visited
England, and there defeated Boden, Medley, Mongrédien, Owen,
Bird and others. He also beat Löwenthal by 9 games to 3
and 2 drawn. In the same year he played a match at Paris with
Harrwitz, winning by 5 to 2 and 1 drawn; and later on he
obtained a victory over Anderssen. On two or three occasions
he played blindfold against eight strong players simultaneously,
each time with great success. He returned to America in 1859
and continued to play, but with decreasing interest in the game,
until 1866. He died in 1884.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Steinitz (b. 1836) took the sixth prize at the London
congress of 1862. He defeated Blackburne in a match by
7 to 1 and 2 drawn. In 1866 he beat Anderssen in a match by
8 games to 6. In 1868 he carried off the first prize in the British
Chess Association handicap, and in 1872 in the London grand
tourney, also defeating Zukertort in a match by 7 games to 1
and 4 drawn. In 1873 he carried off the first prize at the Vienna
congress; and in 1876 he defeated Blackburne, winning 7 games
right off. In 1872-1874, in conjunction with W.N. Potter,
he conducted and won a telegraphic correspondence match for
London against Vienna. In Philidor&rsquo;s age it was considered
almost incredible that he should be able to play three simultaneous
games without seeing board or men, but Paulsen, Blackburne
and Zukertort often played 10 or 12 such games, while as many
as 14 and 15 have been so played.</p>

<p>In 1876 England was in the van of the world&rsquo;s chess army.
English-born players then were Boden, Burn, Macdonnell, Bird,
Blackburne and Potter; whilst among naturalized English
players were Löwenthal, Steinitz, Zukertort, who died in 1888,
and Horwitz. This illustrious contingent was reinforced in
1878 by Mason, an Irish-American, who came over for the
Paris tournament; by Gunsberg, a Hungarian; and later by
Teichmann, who also made England his home. English chess
flourished under the leadership of these masters, the chief prizes
in tournaments being consistently carried off by the English
representatives.</p>

<p>To gauge the progress made by the game since about 1875
it will suffice to give the following statistics. In London Simpson&rsquo;s
Divan was formerly the chief resort of chess players; the
St George&rsquo;s Chess Club was the principal chess club in the West
End, and the City of London Chess Club in the east. About
a hundred or more clubs are now scattered all over the city.
Formerly only the British Chess Association existed; after its
dissolution the now defunct Counties&rsquo; Chess Association took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
its place, and this was superseded by the re-establishment by
Mr Hoffer of the British Chess Association, which again fell
into abeyance after having organized three international tournaments&mdash;London, 1886; Bradford, 1888; and Manchester, 1890&mdash;and four national tournaments. There were various reasons
why the British Chess Association ceased to exercise its functions, one being that minor associations did not feel inclined to merge their identity in a central association. The London League was established, besides the Northern Chess Union, the Southern Counties&rsquo; Chess Union, the Midland Counties&rsquo; Union, the Kent County Association; and there are associations in Surrey, Sussex, Essex, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, Cambridgeshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Lancashire. All these associations are supported by the affiliated chess clubs of the respective counties. Scotland (which has its own association), Wales and Ireland have also numerous clubs.</p>

<p>Still, England did not produce one new eminent player between
1875 and 1905. First-class chess remained in the hands of the
veterans Burn, Blackburne, Mason and Bird. The old amateurs
passed away, their place being taken by a new generation of
powerful amateurs, so well equipped that Great Britain could
hold its own in an amateur contest against the combined forces
of Germany, Austria, Holland and Russia. The terms <i>master</i>
and <i>amateur</i> are not used in any invidious sense, but simply as designating, in the former case, first-class players, and in the latter, those just on the borderland of highest excellence. The
professional element as it existed in the heydey of Simpson&rsquo;s
Divan almost disappeared, the reason being the increased number
of chess clubs, where enthusiasts and students might indulge
in their favourite pastime to their heart&rsquo;s content, tournaments
with attractive prizes being arranged during the season. The
former occupation of the masters vanished in consequence; the
few who remained depended upon the passing visitors from the
provinces who were eager to test their strength by the standard
of the master. Blackburne visited the provinces annually,
keeping the interest in first-class chess alive by his simultaneous
play and his extraordinary skill as a blindfold player&mdash;unsurpassed
until the advent of Harry Nelson Pillsbury (1872-1906),
the leading American master since Morphy.</p>

<p>Germany has produced great chess players in Tarrasch,
E. Lasker, Lipke, Fritz, Bardeleben, Walbrodt and Mieses,
besides a goodly number of amateurs. Austria produced
Max Weiss, Schlechter, Marco and Hruby, to say nothing of
such fine players as the Fleissigs, Dr Mertner, Dr Kaufmann,
Fahndrich, Jacques Schwarz and others. Hungary was worthily
represented by Maroczy, Makovetz and Brody, Maroczy being
the best after Charousek&rsquo;s death. Russia, having lost Jaenisch,
Petroff and Schumoff, discovered Tchigorin, Janowsky,
Schiffers, Alapin, Winawer and Taubenhaus. France showed
a decline for many years, having only the veteran M. Arnous
de Rivière and the naturalized M. Rosenthal left, followed by
Goetz and two good amateurs, MM. Didier and Billecard.
Italy had only Signer Salvioli, although Signer Reggio came to
the fore. Holland had a fair number of players equal to the
English amateurs, but no master since the promising young
van Lennep died.</p>

<p>The first modern International Chess Tournament held in
London in 1851 was the forerunner of various similar contests
of which the following is a complete table:&mdash;</p>

<p>1872. English Championship Cup. 1 Wisker (becoming permanent
        holder of the cup), 2 De Vere.</p>
<p>1873. Vienna. &emsp;1 Steinitz, 2 Blackburne, 3 Anderssen.</p>
<p>1876. London. &emsp;1 Blackburne, 2 Zukertort, 3 Potter.</p>
<p>1878. Paris. &emsp;1 Zukertort, 2 Winawer (after a tie with Zukertort),
        3 Blackburne.</p>
<p>1880. Wiesbaden. &emsp;1, 2, and 3, a tie between Blackburne, Englisch
        and A. Schwarz.</p>
<p>1881. Berlin. &emsp;1 Blackburne, 2 Zukertort, 3 Tchigorin and Winawer.
        Tchigorin made his first public appearance in this contest.</p>
<p>1882. Vienna. &emsp;1 Steinitz and Winawer, 3 Mason.</p>
<p>1883. London. &emsp;1 Zukertort, 2 Steinitz, 3 Blackburne.</p>
<p>1883. Nuremberg. &emsp;1 Winawer, 2 Blackburne, 3 Mason. This
        tournament is a milestone in modern chess history. The
        prizes being comparatively small, it was thought that it
        necessarily must be a failure, the munificently endowed
        London tournament having just been completed. But,
        strange to say, whilst in London fourteen players competed,
        there were nineteen entries in Nuremberg. Winawer, not
        placed in the former, won the first prize in the latter.</p>
<p>1885. Hamburg. &emsp;1 Gunsberg; the next prizes were divided by
        Blackburne, Mason, Englisch, Tarrasch and Weiss.</p>
<p>1885. Hereford. &emsp;1 Blackburne, 2 and 3 Bird and Schallopp.</p>
<p>1886. London. &emsp;1 Blackburne, 2 Burn, 3 Gunsberg and Taubenhaus.</p>
<p>1886. Nottingham. &emsp;1 Burn, 2 Schallopp, 3 Gunsberg and Zukertort.</p>
<p>1887. Frankfort. &emsp;1 Mackenzie, 2 Blackburne and Weiss.</p>
<p>1888. Bradford. &emsp;1 Gunsberg, 2 Mackenzie, 3 Mason and Bardeleben.</p>
<p>1889. New York. &emsp;1 Tchigorin and Weiss, 3 Gunsberg.</p>
<p>1889. Breslau. &emsp;1 Tarrasch, 2 Burn, 3 Weiss.</p>
<p>1890. Amsterdam. &emsp;1 Burn, 2 Lasker, 3 Mason. There were only
        nine competitors, Lasker unexpectedly losing to van Vliet
        by a trap.</p>
<p>1890. Manchester. &emsp;1 Tarrasch, 2 Blackburne, 3 Bird and Mackenzie.</p>
<p>1892. Dresden. &emsp;1 Tarrasch, 2 Makovetz and Forges. Blackburne
        received a special prize.</p>
<p>1894. Leipzig. &emsp;1 Tarrasch, 2 Lipke and Teichmann.</p>
<p>1895. Hastings. &emsp;1 Pillsbury, 2 Tchigorin, 3 Lasker. This tournament
        is historical for the first appearance of Pillsbury, the
        American champion, and Maroczy, the Hungarian champion.</p>
<p>1896. Nuremberg. &emsp;1 Lasker, 2 Maroczy, 3 Pillsbury and Tarrasch.</p>
<p>1896. Budapest. &emsp;1 Tchigorin, 2 Charousek, 3 Pillsbury.</p>
<p>1897. Berlin. &emsp;1 Charousek, 2 Walbrodt, 3 Blackburne. Englisch
        had to abandon the tournament and return to Vienna ill.
        He never recovered and died a few weeks later.</p>
<p>1898. Vienna. &emsp;1 Tarrasch, 2 Pillsbury, 3 Janowsky. Tarrasch
        achieved a remarkable victory in this important tournament.
        Pillsbury&rsquo;s chances were better than his, but he managed
        to run him neck and neck and beat him in the tie match
        which followed.</p>
<p>1898. Cologne. &emsp;1 Burn, 2 Charousek, Cohn and Tchigorin.</p>
<p>1899. London. &emsp;1 Lasker, 2 Janowsky, Maroczy and Pillsbury.
        Janowsky sacrificed the second prize by trying to win a
        game against Steinitz when with an easy draw in hand he
        could have secured the second place for himself alone.</p>
<p>1900. Munich. &emsp;Tie between Maroczy, Pillsbury and Schlechter for
        three chief prizes.</p>
<p>1900. Paris, &emsp;1 Lasker, 2 Pillsbury, 3 Maroczy and Marshall.</p>
<p>1901. Monte Carlo. &emsp;1 Janowsky, 2 Schlechter, 3 Scheve and
        Tehigorin. A novel rule was introduced at this tournament,
        viz. the first drawn game to count ¼ to each player, to be
        replayed, and in case of a draw again to count ¼ each, and
        in case of win &frac12; to the winner. Theoretically this seems
        logical, but in practice it did not work well.</p>
<p>1902. Monte Carlo. &emsp;1 Pillsbury and Maroczy, 3 Janowsky.</p>
<p>1902. Hanover. &emsp;1 Janowsky, 2 Pillsbury, 3 Atkins.</p>
<p>1903. Monte Carlo. &emsp;1 Tarrasch, 2 Maroczy, 3 Pillsbury.</p>
<p>1904. Monte Carlo. &emsp;1 Maroczy, 2 Schlechter, 3 Marshall.</p>
<p>1904. Cambridge Springs, &emsp;1 Marshall, 2 Lasker and Janowsky.</p>
<p>1905. Ostend. &emsp;1 Maroczy, 2 Tarrasch and Janowsky.</p>
<p>1905. Scheveningen. &emsp;1 Marshall, 2 Leussen, 3 Spielmann.</p>
<p>1906. Stockholm. &emsp;1 Schlechter and Bernstein, 3 Mieses.</p>
<p>1906. Ostend. &emsp;1 Schlechter, 2 Maroczy, 3 Rubenstein.</p>
<p>1906. Nuremberg, &emsp;1 Marshall, 2 Duras, 3 Schlechter and Fleischmann.</p>
<p>1907. Vienna, &emsp;1 Mieses, 2 Duras, 3 Maroczy and Vidmare.</p>
<p>1907. Ostend. &emsp;1 Bernstein and Rubenstein, 3 Mieses.</p>
<p>1907. Ostend. &emsp;1 Tarrasch, 2 Schlechter, 3 Janowsky and Marshall.</p>
<p>1907. Carlsbad. &emsp;1 Rubenstein, 2 Maroczy, 3 Niemzowitch and
        Leonhardt.</p>
</div>

<p>In the absence of any recognized authority to confer the title
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
of chess champion of the world, it has usually been appropriated
by the most successful competitor in tournaments. On this
ground Tarrasch claimed the title in 1907, although Lasker, who
had twice beaten Steinitz, the previous champion, in championship
matches, in addition to such masters as Bird, Blackburne,
Mieses and Marshall, was well qualified to assume it. Accordingly
in arranging the programme for the tournament at Ostend
in 1907 it was agreed that the winner of this contest should
receive the title of tournament champion, and should play a
match with Lasker for the championship of the world. Tarrasch
having proved successful at Ostend, the match between him
and Lasker was played at Munich in September 1908, and resulted
in the victory of Lasker by 8 games to 3 and 5 draws.</p>

<p>Chess has developed various schools of play from time to time.
The theory of the game, however, did not advance in proportion
to the enormous strides in its popularity. Formerly the theory
of play had been enriched by such enthusiasts as Dr Max Lange,
Louis Paulsen, Professor Anderssen, Neumann, Dr Suhle,
Falkbeer, Kieseritzki, Howard Staunton, Dr Zukertort, W. N.
Potter and Steinitz, foremost amongst them being Louis Paulsen.
The openings were thoroughly overhauled, new variations discovered
and tested in practical play over the board. These
are now things of the past. The masters who find flaws in old
variations and discover new ones bring them to light only in
matches or tournaments, as new discoveries have now a market
value and may gain prizes in matches or tournaments. The
old &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; school consequently became extinct, and the
eliminating process resulted in the retention of a small répertoire
only, sufficient for practical purposes in important contests.
Gambits and kindred openings containing elements of chance
were avoided, and the whole stock which a first-class player
requires is a thorough knowledge of the &ldquo;Ruy Lopez,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Pawn Openings,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;French&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sicilian
Defences&rdquo;&mdash;openings which contain the least element of chance.
The <i>répertoire</i> being restricted it necessarily follows that the
scope for grand combinations is also diminished and only
strategy or position play remains. The &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; school
invariably aimed at an attack on the king&rsquo;s position at any cost;
nowadays the struggle is to obtain a minute advantage, and the
whole plan consists in finding or creating a weak spot in the
opponent&rsquo;s arrangement of forces; such is the theory of the
modern school, conceived and advocated by Steinitz. But it is
a curious fact that Steinitz founded the modern school rather
late in life. He felt his powers of combination waning, and being
the world&rsquo;s champion and eager to retain that title, he started
the new theory. This novel departure revolutionized chess
entirely. The attacking and combination style was sacrificed
to a sound, sober and dry method; but Steinitz, strange to say,
was not even the best exponent of his own theory, this position
falling to younger players, Siegbert Tarrasch, Schlechter, Amos
Burn and Emanuel Lasker. Pillsbury and Janowsky adhered
to both styles, the former in a high degree, and so did Zukertort
and Charousek; Tchigorin being a free-lance with a style of his
own. The old charm of the game disappeared&mdash;in match and
tournament play at least&mdash;and beauty was sacrificed to exact
calculation and to scoring points. This is to be regretted, for
the most beautiful games still occur when a player resorts to
the gambits. One of the finest games in the Hastings tournament
was played by Tchigorin against Pillsbury, and this was
a &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Gambit Declined.&rdquo; Charousek won a &ldquo;Bishop&rsquo;s
Gambit&rdquo; against Dr Lasker in the Nuremberg tournament;
and some brilliant games occur in the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Gambit Declined,&rdquo;
if either White or Black sacrifices the KP. Another
reason why gambits should be adopted by players in tournaments
is that competitors would necessarily be readily prepared
for the regulation openings, so that the gambits might take them
by surprise. After all, the new school is a natural consequence
of the progress of the game. Paulsen, Anderssen and Tchigorin
devoted a lifetime to the Evans Gambit, volumes of analyses
were written on it, and then Lasker revives an obsolete defence,
and the Evans Gambit disappears! Zukertort achieved a great
success with &ldquo;1. Kt to KB3&rdquo; in the London tournament, 1883,
and this, or the kindred &ldquo;1. P to Q4&rdquo; opening, has since become
the trusty weapon in serious encounters. Lasker wrote <i>Common
Sense in Chess</i>, and gave the best defences of the Ruy Lopez (a
certain form of it); but the &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; was demolished
in the Paris and Nuremberg tournaments, and old forms of that
remarkable opening have to be refurbished. These instances will
suffice to show the reason for the cautious style of modern times.
The Moltkes have replaced the Napoleons.</p>

<p>The old versatility of style could be revived if club tournaments
were organized differently. The players might be compelled
to adopt one single opening only in a two-round contest, each
player thus having attack and defence in turn. The next season
another opening would form the programme, and so on. Even
in international tournaments this condition might be imposed;
the theory would be enriched; full scope would be given to
power of combination and ingenuity; whilst the game would be
more interesting.</p>

<p>There are still amateurs who devote their energies to the
theory of the game; but so long as innovations or new discoveries
are not tested by masters in serious games, they are of
no value. Steinitz used to keep a number of new discoveries
ready to be produced in masters&rsquo; contests, the result being that
his novelties were regularly demolished when it came to a
practical test. The mistake was that he did not try his novelties
over the board with an opponent of equal strength, instead of
trusting to his own judgment alone.</p>

<p>The British Chess Federation was instituted in 1904, its
first congress being held at Hastings in that year, when a British
championship, a ladies&rsquo; championship and a first-class amateur
tournament were played. These competitions have been continued
annually at the congresses of the federation, with the
following results:&mdash;</p>

<p>Since 1899 cable matches have also been played annually
between representatives of English and American universities;
of the first six three were won by England, the remaining three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
being drawn. In England chess matches have been played
annually since 1873 between the universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, seven players on each side. Up to 1907 Oxford
won eleven matches, Cambridge twenty-one, and three were
drawn.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature of the Game</span>.&mdash;The first known writer on chess was Jacobus de Cessolis (Jacopo Dacciesole), whose main object, however, though he gives the moves, &amp;c., was to teach morals rather
than chess. He was a Dominican friar, and his treatise, <i>Solatium
Ludi Scacchorum, scilicet, Libellus de Moribus Hominum et Officiis
Nobilium</i>, was written before the year 1200. It was afterwards
translated into French, and in the year 1474 Caxton, under the title
of <i>The Game and Playe of Chesse</i>, printed an English translation of the French version.</p>

<p>In 1490 we have the <i>Göttinger Handschrift</i>, a work containing nine different openings and fifty problems. The author of this manuscript is not known. Then comes Vicent, a Spanish writer, whose book bears date 1495. Only the title-page has been preserved, the rest of the work having been lost in the first Carlist war. Of Lucena,
another Spanish author who wrote in or about 1497, we are better
informed. His treatise, <i>Repeticion des Amores y Arte de Axedres</i>, comprises various practical chess matters, including 150 positions, illustrated by 160 well-executed woodcuts. Various of these
positions are identical with those in the <i>Göttinger Handschrift</i>.In
the 16th century works upon the game were written by Damiano,
Ruy Lopez and Horatio Gianutio della Mantia; in the 17th century
by Salvio, Polerio, Gustavus Selenus, Carrera, Greco, Fr. Antonio
and the authors of the <i>Traité de Lausanne</i>; in the 18th century by Bertin, Stamma, Ercole del Rio, Lolli, Cozio, Philidor, Ponziani,
Stein, van Nyevelt, Allgaier and Peter Pratt; in the 19th century
by J.F.W. Koch and C.F. Koch, Sarratt, John Cochrane, Wm.
Lewis, Silberschmidt, Ghulam Kassim and James Cochrane, George
Walker, A. MacDonnell, Jaenisch, Petroff, von Bilguer, von der
Lasa, Staunton, Kling and Horwitz, Bledow, Dubois, Kieseritzki,
Max Lange, Löwenthal, Dufresne, Neumann, Suhle, Zukertort, Preti
and others.</p>

<p>English chess owes much to W. Lewis and George Walker. But
to Howard Staunton must be ascribed the most important share in
creating the later popularity which the game achieved in England.
Staunton&rsquo;s first work, <i>The Chess Player&rsquo;s Handbook</i>, was published in 1847, and again (revised) in 1848. For want of further adequate revision many of its variations are now out of date; but taking the handbook as it was when issued, very high praise must be bestowed upon the author. His other works are: <i>The Chess Player&rsquo;s Text-Book</i> and <i>The Chess Player&rsquo;s Companion</i> (1849) (the latter being a collection of his own games), the <i>Chess Praxis</i> (1860), republished in 1903, his posthumous Work, <i>Chess Theory and Practice</i>, edited by R.B. Wormald (1876), and various smaller treatises. The laws of the game as laid down in the <i>Praxis</i> formed the basis of the rules adopted by the British Chess Association in 1862. Besides editing <i>The Chess Player&rsquo;s Chronicle</i> and <i>The Chess World</i>, he was the chess
editor of <i>The Illustrated London News</i> from 1844 till his death in 1874.</p>

<p>Among continental chess authorities von Heydebrandt und der
Lasa (more usually known by his second title) stood pre-eminent.
The German <i>Handbuch</i> was completed in 1843 by von Bilguer, who died before the first edition was completed. The second, third, fourth and fifth editions (the last published in 1874) were edited and revised by von der Lasa.</p>

<p>Among the more important modern works the following may
be mentioned: Vasquez, <i>El Ajedrez de memoria; La Odisea de
Pablo Morphy</i> (Havana, 1893); Bauer, <i>Schachlexikon</i> (Leipzig, 1893); Jean Dufresne, <i>Kleines Lehrbuch des Schachspiels</i> (6th ed., Leipzig, 1893); E. Freeborough and Rev. C.E.

<p><span class="bold">CHEST<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="kistê">&#954;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;</span>, Lat. <i>cista</i>, O. Eng. <i>cist, cest</i>,&amp;c.),
a large box of wood or metal with a hinged lid. The term is also used
of a variety of kinds of receptacle; and in anatomy is transferred
to the portion of the body covered by the ribs and breastbone
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Respiratory System</a></span>). In the more ordinary meaning
chests are, next to the chair and the bed, the most ancient articles
of domestic furniture. The chest was the common receptacle
for clothes and valuables, and was the direct ancestor of the
&ldquo;chest of drawers,&rdquo; which was formed by enlarging the chest
and cutting up the front. It was also frequently used as a seat.
Indeed, in its origin it took in great measure the place of the
chair, which, although familiar enough to the ancients, had
become a luxury in the days when the chest was already an
almost universal possession. The chief use of chests was as
wardrobes, but they were also often employed for the storing of
valuables. In the early middle ages the rich possessed them in
profusion, used them as portmanteaux, and carried them about
from castle to castle. These portable receptacles were often
covered with leather and emblazoned with heraldic designs.
As houses gradually became less sparsely furnished, chests and
beds and other movables were allowed to remain stationary,
and the chest lost its covered top, and took the shape in which we
best know it&mdash;that of an oblong box standing upon raised feet.
As a rule it was made of oak, but it was sometimes of chestnut
or other hard wood.</p>

<p>There are, properly speaking, three types of chest&mdash;the
domestic, the ecclesiastical and the strong box or coffer. Old
domestic chests still exist in great number and some variety,
but the proportion of those earlier than the latter part of the
Tudor period is very small; most of them are Jacobean in date.
Very frequently they were made to contain the store of
house-linen which a bride took to her husband upon her marriage.
In the 17th century Boulle and his imitators glorified the
marriage-coffer until it became a gorgeous casket, almost indeed a
sarcophagus, inlaid with ivory and ebony and precious woods, and
enriched with ormolu, supported upon a stand of equal magnificence.
The Italian marriage-chests (<i>cassone</i>) were also of a
richness which was never attempted in England. The main
characteristics of English domestic chests (which not infrequently
are carved with names and dates) are panelled fronts and ends,
the feet being formed from prolongations of the &ldquo;stiles&rdquo; or side
posts. There were, however, exceptions, and a certain number
of 17th-century chests have separate feet, either circular or
shaped after the indications of a somewhat later style. There
is usually a strong architectural feeling about the chest, the front
being divided into panels, which are plain in the more ordinary
examples, and richly carved in the choicer ones. The plinth and
frieze are often of well-defined <i>guilloche</i> work, or are
carved with arabesques or conventionalized flowers. Architectural
detail, especially the detail of wainscoting, has indeed been
followed with considerable fidelity, many of the earlier chests
being carved in the linenfold pattern, while the Jacobean
examples are often mere reproductions of the pilastered and
recessed oaken mantelpieces of the period. Occasionally a
chest is seen which is inlaid with coloured woods, or with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
geometrical parquetry. Perhaps the most elaborate type of
English parquetry chest is that named after the vanished Palace
of Nonesuch. Such pieces are, however, rarely met with. The
entire front of this type is covered with a representation of the
palace in coloured woods. Another class of chest is incised, sometimes
rather roughly, but often with considerable geometrical
skill. The more ordinary variety has been of great value to the
forger of antique furniture, who has used its carved panels for
conversion into cupboards and other pieces, the history of
which is not easily unravelled by the amateur who collects old
oak without knowing much about it. Towards the end of the
17th century chests were often made of walnut, or even of exotic
woods such as cedar and cypress, and were sometimes clamped
with large and ornamental brass bands and hinges. The chests
of the 18th century were much larger than those of the preceding
period, and as often as not were furnished with two drawers at
the bottom&mdash;an arrangement but rarely seen in those of the 17th
century&mdash;while they were often fitted with a small internal box
fixed across one end for ready access to small articles. The chest
was not infrequently unpanelled and unornamented, and in the
latter period of its history this became the ruling type. It will
not have been forgotten that it was in an old oak chest that the
real or mythical heroine of the pathetic ballad of &ldquo;The Mistletoe
Bough&rdquo; concealed herself, to her undoing.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical chests appear to have been used almost entirely
as receptacles for vestments and church plate, and those which
survive are still often employed for the preservation of parish
documents. A considerable variety of these interesting and
often exceedingly elaborate chests are still left in English
churches. They are usually of considerable size, and of a length
disproportionate to their depth. This no doubt was to facilitate
the storage of vestments. Most of them are of great antiquity.
Many go back to the 14th century, and here and there they are
even earlier, as in the case of the coffer in Stoke d&rsquo;Abernon
church, Surrey, which is unquestionably 13th-century work.
One of the most remarkable of these early examples is in Newport
church, Essex. It is one of the extremely rare painted coffers
of the 13th century, the front carved with an upper row of shields,
from which the heraldic painting has disappeared, and a lower
row of roundels. Between is a belt of open tracery, probably of
pewter, and the inside of the lid is decorated with oil paintings
representing the Crucifixion, the Virgin Mary, St Peter, St John
and St Paul. The well-known &ldquo;jewel chest&rdquo; in St Mary&rsquo;s,
Oxford, is one of the earliest examples of 14th century work.
Many of these ecclesiastical chests are carved with architectural
motives&mdash;traceried windows most frequently, but occasionally
with the iinenfold pattern. There is a whole class of chests
known as &ldquo;tilting coffers,&rdquo; carved with representations of
tournaments or feats of arms, and sometimes with a grotesque
admixture of chivalric figures and mythical monsters. Only
five or six examples of this type are known still to exist in
England, and two of them are now in the Victoria and Albert
Museum. It is not certain that even these few are of English origin&mdash;indeed,  very many of the chests and coffers of the 16th and 17th centuries are of foreign make. They were imported into England
chiefly from Flanders, and were subsequently carved by native
artisans, as was the case with other common pieces of furniture
of those periods. The <i>huche</i> or &ldquo;hutch&rdquo; was a rough type of
household chest.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;coffer&rdquo; is properly applied to a chest which was
intended for the safe keeping of valuables. As a rule the coffer
is much more massive in construction than the domestic chest;
it is clamped by iron bands, sometimes contains secret receptacles
opening with a concealed spring, and is often furnished with an
elaborate and complex lock, which occupies the whole of the
underside of the lid. Pieces of this type are sometimes described
as Spanish chests, from the belief that they were taken from
ships belonging to the Armada. It is impossible to say that this
may not sometimes have been the case, but these strong boxes
are frequently of English origin, although the mechanism of the
locks may have been due to the subtle skill of foreign locksmiths.
A typical example of the treasure chest is that which belonged
to Sir Thomas Bodley, and is preserved in the Bodleian library at
Oxford. The locks of this description of chest are of steel, and
are sometimes richly damascened. It was for being implicated
in the breaking open and robbing of just such a chest as this,
to which the Collège de Navarre had confided coin to the value of
500 ecus, that François Villon was hanged on the gibbet of
Montfaucon.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHESTER, EARLS OF<a name="ar112" id="ar112"></a></span>. The important palatine earldom of
Chester was first held by a certain Fleming named Gherbod
(fl. 1070), and then by Hugh of Avranches (d. 1101), a son of
Richard, viscount of Avranches. Hugh, who was probably one
of William the Conqueror&rsquo;s companions, was made earl of Chester
in 1071; he had special privileges in his earldom, and he held
land in twenty counties. He was called <i>Le Gros</i> on account of
his great bulk and <i>Lupus</i> on account of his ferocity. However,
he regarded St Anselm as his friend, and he showed the customary
liberality to religious houses. His life was mainly spent in
fighting the Welsh and in Normandy, and he died on the 27th
of July 1101. Hugh&rsquo;s only son Richard, who was childless,
was drowned in the White Ship in November 1120. Among subsequent holders were Ralph, or Randulph, de Gernon (d. 1153),
who took a prominent part in the civil wars of the reign of
Stephen, fighting first on one side and then on the other; and
his son Hugh de Kevelioc (1147-1181), who shared in the rising
against Henry II. in 1173. But perhaps the most celebrated of
the early earls was Ralph, Ranulf, or Randulph, de Blundevill
(c. 1172-1232), who succeeded his father Hugh de Kevelioc as
earl in 1181, and was created earl of Lincoln in 1217. Ranulf
married Constance, widow of Henry II.&rsquo;s son, Geoffrey of Brittany,
and is sometimes called duke of Brittany and earl of Richmond.
He fought in Wales, was on the side of John during his struggle
with the barons over Magna Carta, and was one of this king&rsquo;s
executors; he also fought for the young king Henry III. against
the French invaders and their allies. In 1218 he went on crusade
to the Holy Land and took part in the capture of Damietta;
then returning to England he died at Wallingford in October
1232. After speaking of Ranulf&rsquo;s unique position in the kingdom,
which &ldquo;fitted him for the part of a leader of opposition to royal
or ministerial tyranny,&rdquo; Stubbs sums up his character in these
words: &ldquo;On more than one occasion he refused his consent to
taxation which he deemed unjust; his jealousy of Hubert (de
Burgh), although it led him to join the foreign party in 1223,
did not prevent him from more than once interposing to prevent
his overthrow. He was, moreover, almost the last relic of the
great feudal aristocracy of the Conquest.&rdquo; Although twice
married he left no children, and his immense possessions passed
to his four sisters. The earl&rsquo;s memory remained green for a long
time, and in the <i>Vision of Piers Plowman</i> his name is linked with that of Robin Hood. In November 1232 the earldom of Chester
was granted to his nephew John the Scot, earl of Huntingdon
(c. 1207-1237), and in 1246, nine years after John had died
childless, it was annexed to the English crown &ldquo;lest so fair a
dominion should be divided among women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1254 Prince Edward, afterwards King Edward I., was created
earl of Chester, and since this date the earldom has always been
held by the heirs apparent to the English crown with the single
exception of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester. Since 1399
the earls of Chester have been also princes of Wales, although
the act of Richard II. (1398), which created Chester into a principality
to be held by the king&rsquo;s eldest son, was revoked by Henry IV.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHESTER<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span>, an episcopal city and county of a city, municipal,
county and parliamentary borough, and the county town of
Cheshire, England, 179 m. N.W. of London. Pop. (1901) 38,309.
It lies in a low plain on the Dee, principally on the north (right)
bank, 6 m. above the embouchure of the river into its wide,
shallow estuary. It is an important railway centre, the principal
lines serving it being the London &amp; North-Western, Great
Western, Cheshire Lines and Great Central. The city is divided
into four principal blocks by the four principal streets&mdash;Northgate
Street, Eastgate Street, Bridge Street and Watergate Street,
which radiate at right angles from the Cross, and terminate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
the four gates. These four streets exhibit in what are called
&ldquo;the Rows&rdquo; a characteristic feature of the city. Their origin
is a mystery, and has given rise to much controversy. In Eastgate
Street, Bridge Street and Watergate Street, the Rows
exist on each side of the street throughout the greater part of
its length, and may be described as continuous galleries open
to the street, over and under which the houses lining the streets
project, and which are formed as it were out of the front first-floor
of the houses, approached by flights of steps from the
roadway. The Rows are flagged or boarded under foot and ceiled
above, thus forming a covered way, standing in the same relation
to the shops, which are at their back, as the foot pavement
does in other towns. In Northgate Street, on the other hand,
the Row on the west side is formed as it were out of the ground
floor of the houses, having cellars beneath, while on the east side
the Row is formed at the same elevation as in the other three
principal streets. In these streets are several examples of old
timbered houses and some good modern imitations of them,&mdash;all
combining to give a picturesque and individual character
to the city. Among the most interesting of the ancient houses are
Derby House, bearing the date 1591, Bishop Lloyd&rsquo;s house, and
God&rsquo;s Providence House in Watergate Street, and the Bear and
Billet in Lower Bridge Street; the three last date from the 17th
century. There is also a chamber with stone groined roof of the
14th century in the basement of a house in Eastgate Street, and
another of a similar character in Watergate Street. A mortuary
chapel of the early part of the 13th century exists in the basement
of a house in Bridge Street.</p>

<p>Chester is the only city in England that still possesses its walls
perfect in their entire circuit of 2 m. The gateways have all been
rebuilt at various dates; the north and east gates on the site of
the Roman gates. The Grosvenor bridge, a single span of stone
200 ft. in length, said to be the largest save one in Europe,
carries the road to Wrexham and Shrewsbury over the Dee on the
south-west; while the old bridge of seven arches is interesting
on account of its antiquity and picturesqueness. The castle,
with the exception of &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s Tower,&rdquo; and a round tower with
adjacent buildings, in the upper ward, was taken down towards
the end of the 18th century, and replaced by a gateway, barracks,
county hall, gaol and assize courts.</p>

<p>The cathedral church of Christ and the Virgin Mary, which
stands towards the north of the city within the walls, rose on the
site of a church of extreme antiquity. It appears that the
dedication of this church was altered, perhaps in the reign of
Athelstan, from St. Peter and St Paul to St Werburgh and
St Oswald, St Werburgh being a niece of St Etheldreda of Ely.
In 1093 Hugh Lupus, earl of Chester, richly endowed the foundation
as a Benedictine monastery. The bishops of Mercia had
apparently a seat at Chester, but the city had ceased to be episcopal,
until in 1075 Peter, bishop of Lichfield, removed his seat
thence to Chester, having for his cathedral the collegiate church
of St John. The seat of the see, however, was quickly removed
again to Coventry (1102), but Cheshire continued subject to
Lichfield until in 1541 Chester was erected into a bishopric by
Henry VIII., the church of the dissolved abbey of St Werburgh
becoming the cathedral. The diocese covers nearly the whole
of Cheshire, with very small portions of Lancashire and Staffordshire.
The cathedral does not rank among the most splendid
English churches, but possesses certain details of the highest
interest, and gains in beauty from the tones of its red sandstone
walls and the picturesque close in which it stands. It is cruciform
with a central tower 127 ft. high. The south transept is larger
than the north. The nave is short (145 ft.), being of six bays;
the southern arcade is Decorated, while the northern, which
differs in detail, is of uncertain date. The basement of the north-western
tower&mdash;all that remains of it, now used as a baptistery&mdash;is
Norman, and formed part of Hugh Lupus&rsquo; church; and the
fabric of the north wall is also of this period. The north transept
also retains Norman work, and its size shows the original plan,
as the existence of the conventual buildings to the north probably
rendered its extension undesirable. The south transept has
aisles, with Decorated and Perpendicular windows. The fine
organ stands on a screen across the north transept; but some
of its pipes are upon the choir screen, both screens being the
work of Sir Gilbert Scott. The style of the choir is transitional
from Early English to Decorated, and its length is 125 ft. It
is a fine example, and its beauty is enhanced by the magnificent
series of ancient carved wooden stalls unsurpassed in England.
The Lady Chapel, east of the choir, is of rich Early English
workmanship. Of the conventual buildings the cloisters are
Perpendicular. The chapter-house, entered by a beautiful
vestibule from the east cloister, and lined with cases containing
the chapter library, is Early English (c. 1240). The refectory,
adjoining the north cloister, is of the same period, with Perpendicular
insertions; it has been curtailed in size, but retains its
beautiful Early English lector&rsquo;s pulpit. An early Norman
chamber, with massive pillars and vaulting, adjoins the west
cloister, and may be the substructure of the abbot&rsquo;s house. The
abbey gateway is of the 14th century.</p>

<p>Within the walls there are several churches of ancient foundation;
thus St Peter&rsquo;s is said to occupy the site of a church erected
by Æthelflæd, queen of Mercia, and St Mary&rsquo;s dates from
the 12th century. None, however, is of any special interest;
but the church of St John, outside the walls, which as already
stated became the cathedral in 1075, is a massive early Norman
structure, with later additions, and, especially as regards the
exterior, considerably restored in modern times. Its fine tower
fell in 1881. It was a collegiate church until 1547, and there are
some remains of the adjoining buildings. Among numerous
modern churches there may be mentioned St Mary&rsquo;s without the
walls, built in 1887 by the duke of Westminster, of red sandstone,
with a fine spire&rsquo; and peal of bells.</p>

<p>Among the chief secular buildings, the town hall replaced in
1869 the old exchange, which had been burnt down in 1862.
The Grosvenor Museum and School of Art, the foundation of
which was suggested by Charles Kingsley the novelist, when
canon of Chester cathedral, contains many local antiquities,
along with a fine collection of the fauna of Cheshire and the
neighbourhood. The King&rsquo;s school was founded by Henry VIII.
(1541), who provided that twenty-four poor scholars should be
taught free of cost. It was reorganized as a public school in
1873, and possesses twelve king&rsquo;s scholarships tenable in the
school, and close scholarships tenable at the universities. Among
other schools may be mentioned the blue-coat school (1700),
the Queen&rsquo;s school for girls (1878), the girls&rsquo; school attached to
the Roman Catholic convent, and the diocesan training college
for schoolmasters. For recreation provision is made by the New
Grosvenor Park, presented to the city in 1867 by the marquess
of Westminster; Handbridge Park, opened in 1892; and the
Roodee, a level tract by the river at the base of the city wall,
appropriated as a race-course. An annual race-meeting is held
in May and attendedby thousands. The chief event is the race
for the Chester Cup, which dates from 1540, when a silver bell
was given as the prize by the Saddlers&rsquo; Company. Pleasure
vessels ply on the Dee in summer, and an annual regatta is held,
at which all the principal northern rowing-clubs are generally
represented. The town gains in prosperity from its large number
of visitors. The principal industries are carried on without the
walls, where there are lead, shot and paint works, leather and
tobacco factories, and iron foundries. The trade gilds number
twenty-four. There is a considerable amount of shipping on the
Dee, the navigation having been much improved in modern
times. The parliamentary borough returns one member. The
municipal council consists of a mayor, 10 aldermen and 30
councillors. Area, 2862 acres.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Setting aside the numerous legends with regard to
the existence of a British city on the site now occupied by
Chester, the earliest authentic information relating to its history
is furnished by the works of Ptolemy and Antoninus. As the
Roman station of Deva it was probably founded about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 48
by Ostorius Scapula, and from its advantageous position, both
as the key to communication with Ireland and as a bulwark
against the hostile tribes of the north, it became a military and
commercial centre of considerable importance. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 78-79
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
it was the winter-quarters of Agricola, and later became illustrious
as the permanent headquarters of Legio XX. Valeria Victrix.
Many inscriptions and remains of the Roman military occupation
have been found, and the north and east walls stand in great
part on Roman foundations. The Saxon form of the name
was Leganceaster. About 614 the city was captured and
destroyed by Æthelfrith, and henceforth lay in ruins until
Æthelflæd in 907 rebuilt the walls, restored the monastery of St
Werburgh, and made the city &ldquo;nigh two such as it was before.&rdquo;
In the reign of Æthelstan a mint was set up at Chester, and in
973 it was the scene of Edgar&rsquo;s truimph when, it is said, he was
rowed on the Dee by six subject kings. Chester opposed a determined
resistance to the Conqueror, and did not finally surrender
until 1070. On the erection of Cheshire to a county palatine
after the Conquest, Chester became the seat of government of the
palatine earls. The Domesday account of the city includes a
description of the Saxon laws under which it had been governed
in the time of Edward the Confessor. All the land, except the
bishop&rsquo;s borough, was held of the earl, and assessed at fifty
hides. There were seven mint-masters and twelve magistrates,
and the city paid a fee-farm rent of £45. It had been much
devastated since the time of Edward the Confessor, and the
number of houses reduced by 205.</p>

<p>The earliest extant charter, granted by Henry II. in 1160,
empowered the burgesses to trade with Durham as freely as they
had done in the reign of Henry I. From this date a large collection
of charters enumerates privileges granted by successive earls
and later sovereigns. One from Ralph or Ranulf de Blundevill,
granted between 1190 and 1211, confirms to the citizens a gild
merchant and all liberties and free customs, and three from
John protect their privilege of trading with Ireland. Edward I.
empowered the citizens to elect coroners and to hold courts of
justice, and granted them the fee-farm of the city at a yearly
rent of £100. In the 14th century Chester began to lose its
standing as a port through the gradual silting up of the estuary
of the Dee, and the city was further impoverished by the inroads
of the Welsh and by the necessity of rebuilding the Dee bridge,
which had been swept away by an unusually high tide. In consideration
of these misfortunes Richard II. remitted part of the
fee-farm. Continued misfortunes led to a further reduction of
the farm to £50 for a term of fifty years by Henry VI., who also
made a grant for the completion of a new Dee bridge. Henry
VII. reduced the fee-farm to £20, and in 1506 granted to the
citizens what is known as &ldquo;the Great Charter.&rdquo; This charter
constituted the city a county by itself, and incorporated the
governing body under the style of a mayor, twenty-four aldermen
and forty common councilman; it also instituted two sheriffs,
two coroners and a recorder, and the mayor, the ex-mayors
and the recorder were appointed justices of the peace. This
charter was confirmed by James I. and Charles II. A charter of
George III. in 1804 instituted the office of deputy-mayor. The
charter of Hugh Lupus to the abbey of St Werburgh includes
a grant of the tolls of the fair at the feast of St Werburgh
for three days, and a subsequent charter from Ranulf
de Blundevill (12th century) licensed the abbot and monks
to hold their fairs and markets before the abbey gates. A
charter of John the Scot, earl of Chester, mentions fairs at the
feasts of the Nativity of St John Baptist and St Michael. For
many centuries the rights claimed by the abbot in connexion
with the fairs gave rise to constant friction with the civic
authorities, which lasted until, in the reign of Henry VIII.,
it was decreed that the right of holding fairs was vested exclusively
in the citizens. Charles II. in 1685 granted a cattle-fair
to be held on the first Thursday in February.</p>

<p>In 1553 Chester first returned two members to parliament,
having hitherto been represented solely in the parliament of
the palatinate. By the Redistribution Act of 1885 the representation
was reduced to one member. The trades of tanners, skinners
and glove-makers existed at the time of the Conquest, and the
importation of marten skins is mentioned in Domesday. In
the 14th century the woollen trade was considerable, and in 1674
weavers and wool-combers were introduced into Chester from
Norwich. The restoration of the channel of the Dee opened
up a flourishing trade in Irish linen, which in 1786 was at its
height, but from that date gradually diminished.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESTER<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span>, a city of Delaware county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.,
on the Delaware river, about 13 m. S.W. of Philadelphia. Pop.
(1800) 20,226; (1900) 33,988, of whom 5074 were foreign-born
and 44O3 were negroes; (U. S. census, 1910) 38,537. It is served
by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading
railways, by the Philadelphia, Baltimore &amp; Washington division
of the Pennsylvania system, and by steamboat lines. Chester has
several interesting buildings dating from early in the 18th century&mdash;among
them the city hall (1724), one of the oldest public
buildings in the United States, and the house (1683) occupied
for a time by William Penn. It is the seat of the Pennsylvania
Military College (1862); and on the border of Chester, in the
borough of Upland (pop. in 1900, 2131), is the Crozer Theological
Seminary (Baptist), which was incorporated in 1867, opened in
1868, and named after John P. Crozer (1793-1866), by whose
family it was founded. Chester has a large shipbuilding industry,
and manufactories of cotton and worsted goods, iron and
steel, the steel-casting industry being especially important, and
large quantities of wrought iron and steel pipes being
manufactured. Dye-stuffs and leather also are manufactured. The
value of the city&rsquo;s factory products in 1905 was $16,644,842.
Chester is the oldest town in Pennsylvania. It was settled by
the Swedes about 1645, was called Upland and was the seat of the
Swedish courts until 1682, when William Penn, soon after his
landing at a spot in the town now marked by a memorial stone,
gave it its present name. The first provincial assembly was
convened here in December of the same year. After the battle
of Brandywine in the War of Independence, Washington retreated
to Chester, and in the &ldquo;Washington House,&rdquo; still
standing, wrote his account of the battle. Soon afterwards
Chester was occupied by the British. In 1701 it was incorporated
as a borough; in 1795 and again in 1850 it received a new
borough charter; and in 1866 it was chartered as a city. For
a long time it was chiefly a small fishing settlement, its population
as late as 1820 being only 657; but after the introduction of
large manufacturing interests in 1850, when its population was
only 1667, its growth was rapid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESTERFIELD, PHILIP DORMER STANHOPE<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span>, <span class="sc">4th Earl
of</span> (1694-1773), son of Philip Stanhope, third earl (1673-1726),
and Elizabeth Savile, daughter of George Savile, marquess
of Halifax, was born in London on the 22nd of September 1694;
Philip, the first earl (1584-1656), son of Sir John Stanhope of
Shelford, was a royalist who in 1616 was created Baron Stanhope
of Shelford, and in 1628 earl of Chesterfield; and his grandson
the 2nd earl (1633-1714) was grandfather of the 4th earl. Deprived
at an early age of his mother, the care of the boy devolved
upon his grandmother, the marchioness of Halifax, a lady of
culture and connexion, whose house was frequented by the
most distinguished Whigs of the epoch. He soon began to
prove himself possessed of that systematic spirit of conduct
and effort which appeared so much in his life and character.
His education, begun under a private tutor, was continued
(1712) at Trinity Hall, Cambridge; here he remained little
more than a year and seems to have read hard, and to have
acquired a considerable knowledge of ancient and modern
languages. The great orators of all times were a special object
of study with him, and he describes his boyish pedantry pleasantly
enough, but by no means without a touch of self-satisfaction
in the memory. His university training was supplemented
(1714) by a continental tour, untrammelled by a governor;
at the Hague his ambition for the applause awarded to adventure
made a gamester of him, and at Paris he began, from the same
motive, that worship of the conventional Venus, the serious
inculcation of which has earned for him the largest and most
unenviable part of his reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
The death of Anne and the accession of George I. opened up
a career for him and brought him back to England. His relative
James Stanhope (afterwards first Earl Stanhope), the king&rsquo;s
favourite minister, procured for him the place of gentleman of
the bedchamber to the prince of Wales. In 1715 he entered
the House of Commons as Lord Stanhope of Shelford and
member for St Germans, and when the impeachment of James,
duke of Ormonde, came before the House, he used the occasion
(5th of August 1715) to put to proof his old rhetorical studies.
His maiden speech was youthfully fluent and dogmatic; but
on its conclusion the orator was reminded with many compliments,
by an honourable member, that he wanted six weeks of
his majority, and consequently that he was amenable to a fine
of £500 for speaking in the House. Lord Stanhope quitted the
Commons with a low bow and started for the continent. From
Paris he rendered the government important service by gathering
and transmitting information respecting the Jacobite plot;
and in 1716 he returned to England, resumed his seat, and took
frequent part in the debates. In that year came the quarrel
between the king and the heir apparent. Stanhope, whose
politic instinct obliged him to worship the rising rather than the
setting sun, remained faithful to the prince, though he was too
cautious to break entirely with the king&rsquo;s party. He was on
friendly terms with the prince&rsquo;s mistress, Henrietta Howard, afterwards
countess of Suffolk. He maintained a correspondence with
this lady which won for him the hatred of the princess of Wales
(afterwards Queen Caroline). In 1723 a vote for the government
got him the place of captain of the Gentlemen Pensioners. In
January 1725, on the revival of the Bath, the red riband was
offered to him, but was declined.</p>

<p>In 1726 his father died, and Lord Stanhope became earl of
Chesterfield. He took his seat in the Upper House, and his
oratory, never effective in the Commons by reason of its want
of force and excess of finish, at once became a power. In 1728
Chesterfield was sent to the Hague as ambassador. In this place
his tact and temper, his dexterity and discrimination, enabled
him to do good service, and he was rewarded with Walpole&rsquo;s
friendship, a Garter and the place of lord high steward. In 1732
there was born to him, by a certain Mlle du Bouchet, the son,
Philip Stanhope, for whose advice and instruction were afterwards
written the famous <i>Letters</i>. He negotiated the second
treaty of Vienna in 1731, and in the next year, being somewhat
broken in health and fortune, he resigned his embassy and returned
to England.</p>

<p>A few months&rsquo; rest enabled him to resume his seat in the Lords,
of which he was one of the acknowledged leaders. He supported
the ministry, but his allegiance was not the blind fealty Walpole
exacted of his followers. The Excise Bill, the great premier&rsquo;s
favourite measure, was vehemently opposed by him in the Lords,
and by his three brothers in the Commons. Walpole bent before
the storm and abandoned the measure; but Chesterfield was
summarily dismissed from his stewardship. For the next two
years he led the opposition in the Upper House, leaving no stone
unturned to effect Walpole&rsquo;s downfall. In 1741 he signed the
protest for Walpole&rsquo;s dismissal and went abroad on account of
his health. He visited Voltaire at Brussels and spent some
time in Paris, where he associated with the younger Crebillon,
Fontenelle and Montesquieu. In 1742 Walpole fell, and Carteret
was his real, though not his nominal successor. Although
Walpole&rsquo;s administration had been overthrown largely by
Chesterfield&rsquo;s efforts the new ministry did not count Chesterfield
either in its ranks or among its supporters. He remained in
opposition, distinguishing himself by the courtly bitterness of his
attacks on George II., who learned to hate him violently. In
1743 a new journal, <i>Old England; or, the Constitutional Journal</i>
appeared. For this paper Chesterfield wrote under the name of
&ldquo;Jeffrey Broadbottom.&rdquo; A number of pamphlets, in some of
which Chesterfield had the help of Edmund Waller, followed.
His energetic campaign against George II. and his government
won the gratitude of the dowager duchess of Marlborough, who
left him £20,000 as a mark of her appreciation. In 1744 the king
was compelled to abandon Carteret, and the coalition or &ldquo;Broad
Bottom&rdquo; party, led by Chesterfield and Pitt, came into office.
In the troublous state of European politics the earl&rsquo;s conduct
and experience were more useful abroad than at home, and he
was sent to the Hague as ambassador a second time. The object
of his mission was to persuade the Dutch to join in the War of the
Austrian Succession and to arrange the details of their assistance.
The success of his mission was complete; and on his return a
few weeks afterwards he received the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland&mdash;a
place he had long coveted.</p>

<p>Short as it was, Chesterfield&rsquo;s Irish administration was of great
service to his country, and is unquestionably that part of his
political life which does him most honour. To have conceived
and carried out a policy which, with certain reservations, Burke
himself might have originated and owned, is indeed no small
title to regard. The earl showed himself finely capable in practice
as in theory, vigorous and tolerant, a man to be feared and a
leader to be followed; he took the government entirely into his
own hands, repressed the jobbery traditional to the office,
established schools and manufactures, and at once conciliated
and kept in check the Orange and Roman Catholic factions.
In 1746, however, he had to exchange the lord-lieutenancy for
the place of secretary of state. With a curious respect for those
theories his familiarity with the secret social history of France had
caused him to entertain, he hoped and attempted to retain a
hold over the king through the influence of Lady Yarmouth,
though the futility of such means had already been demonstrated
to him by his relations with Queen Caroline&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>ma bonne Howard</i>.&rdquo;
The influence of Newcastle and Sandwich, however, was too
strong for him; he was thwarted and over-reached; and in
1748 he resigned the seals, and returned to cards and his books
with the admirable composure which was one of his most striking
characteristics. He declined any knowledge of the <i>Apology for
a late Resignation, in a Letter from an English Gentleman to his
Friend at The Hague</i>, which ran through four editions in 1748,
but there is little doubt that he was, at least in part, the
author.</p>

<p>The dukedom offered him by George II., whose ill-will his
fine tact had overcome, was refused. He continued for some
years to attend the Upper House, and to take part in its proceedings.
In 1751, seconded by Lord Macclesfield, president of the
Royal Society, and Bradley, the eminent mathematician, he
distinguished himself greatly in the debates on the calendar, and
succeeded in making the new style a fact. Deafness, however,
was gradually affecting him, and he withdrew little by little
from society and the practice of politics. In 1755 occurred
the famous dispute with Johnson over the dedication to the
<i>English Dictionary</i>. In 1747 Johnson sent Chesterfield, who was then secretary of state, a prospectus of his <i>Dictionary</i>, which was acknowledged by a subscription of £10. Chesterfield apparently took no further interest in the enterprise, and the book
was about to appear, when he wrote two papers in the <i>World</i> in praise of it. It was said that Johnson was kept waiting in the
anteroom when he called while Cibber was admitted. In any
case the doctor had expected more help from a professed patron
of literature, and wrote the earl the famous letter in defence
of men of letters. Chesterfield&rsquo;s &ldquo;respectable Hottentot,&rdquo; now
identified with George, Lord Lyttelton, was long supposed,
though on slender grounds, to be a portrait of Johnson. During
the twenty years of life that followed this episode, Chesterfield
wrote and read a great deal, but went little into society.</p>

<p>In 1768 died Philip Stanhope, the child of so many hopes.
The constant care bestowed by his father on his education
resulted in an honourable but not particularly distinguished
career for young Stanhope. His death was an overwhelming
grief to Chesterfield, and the discovery that he had long been
married to a lady of humble origin must have been galling in the
extreme to his father after his careful instruction in worldly
wisdom. Chesterfield, who had no children by his wife, Melusina
von Schulemberg, illegitimate daughter of George I., whom
he married in 1733, adopted his godson, a distant cousin, named
Philip Stanhope (1755-1815), as heir to the title and estates.
His famous jest (which even Johnson allowed to have merit)&mdash;&ldquo;Tyrawley
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
and I have been dead these two years, but we don&rsquo;t
choose to have it known&rdquo;&mdash;is the best description possible of his
humour and condition during the latter part of this period of
decline. To the deafness was added blindness, but his memory
and his fine manners only left him with life; his last words
(&ldquo;Give Dayrolles a chair&rdquo;) prove that he had neither forgotten
his friend nor the way to receive him. He died on the 24th of
March 1773.</p>

<p>Chesterfield was selfish, calculating and contemptuous; he
was not naturally generous, and he practised dissimulation till
it became part of his nature. In spite of his brilliant talents
and of the admirable training he received, his life, on the whole,
cannot be pronounced a success. His anxiety and the pains he
took to become an orator have been already noticed, and Horace
Walpole, who had heard all the great orators, preferred a speech
of Chesterfield&rsquo;s to any other; yet the earl&rsquo;s eloquence is not to be
compared with that of Pitt. Samuel Johnson, who was not
perhaps the best judge in the world, pronounced his manners to
have been &ldquo;exquisitely elegant&rdquo;; yet as a courtier he was utterly
worsted by Robert Walpole, whose manners were anything but
refined, and even by Newcastle. He desired to be known as a
protector of letters and literary men; and his want of heart or
head over the <i>Dictionary</i> dedication, though explained and excused by Croker, none the less inspired the famous change in a
famous line&mdash;&ldquo;Toil, envy, want, <i>the patron</i>, and the jail.&rdquo;
His published writings have had with posterity a very indifferent
success; his literary reputation rests on a volume of letters never
designed to appear in print. The son for whom he worked
so hard and thought so deeply failed especially where his father
had most desired he should succeed.</p>

<p>As a politician and statesman, Chesterfield&rsquo;s fame rests on his
short but brilliant administration of Ireland. As an author he
was a clever essayist and epigrammatist. But he stands or falls
by the <i>Letters to his Son</i>, first published by Stanhope&rsquo;s widow
in 1774, and the <i>Letters to his Godson</i> (1890). The <i>Letters</i> are brilliantly written&mdash;full of elegant wisdom, of keen wit, of admirable portrait-painting, of exquisite observation and deduction. Against the charge of an undue insistence on the external
graces of manner Chesterfield has been adequately defended by
Lord Stanhope (<i>History</i>, iii. 34). Against the often iterated
accusation of immorality, it should be remembered that the
<i>Letters</i> reflected the morality of the age, and that their author
only systematized and reduced to writing the principles of
conduct by which, deliberately or unconsciously, the best and
the worst of his contemporaries were governed.</p>

<p>The earldom of Chesterfield passed at his death to his godson,
already mentioned, as 5th earl, and so to the latter&rsquo;s son and
grandson. On the death of the latter unmarried in 1871, it
passed in succession to two collateral heirs, the 8th and 9th
earls, and so in 1887 to the latter&rsquo;s son as 10th earl.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHESTERFIELD<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span>, a market town and municipal borough in
the Chesterfield parliamentary division of Derbyshire, England,
24 m. N. by E. of Derby, on the Midland and the Great Central
railways. Pop. (1891) 22,009; (1901) 27,185. It lies at the
junction of two streams, the Rother and Hipper, in a populous
industrial district. It is irregularly built, with narrow streets,
but has a spacious market-place. The church of St Mary and All
Saints is a large and beautiful cruciform building principally of
the Decorated period. Its central tower carries a remarkable
twisted spire of wood covered with lead, 230 ft. high; the distortion
has evidently taken place through the use of unseasoned
timber and consequent warping of the woodwork. The church,
which contains numerous interesting monuments, possesses also
the unusual feature of an apsidal Decorated chapel. There is an
example of flamboyant tracery in one of the windows. Among
public buildings, the Stephenson memorial hall (1879), containing
a free library, art and science class-rooms, a theatre and the
rooms of the Chesterfield Institute, commemorates George
Stephenson, the engineer, who resided at Tapton House, close
to Chesterfield, in his later life; he died here in 1848, and was
buried in Trinity church. Chesterfield grammar school was
founded in 1574. The industries of the town include manufactures
of cotton, silk, earthenware, machinery and tobacco,
with brass and iron founding; while slate and stone are quarried,
and there are coal, iron and lead mines in the neighbourhood.
The town is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors.
Area, 1216 acres. In the immediate neighbourhood of Chesterfield
on the west is the urban district of Brampton and Walton
(pop. 2698), to the south-east is Hasland (7427), and to the
north-east Brimington (4569).</p>

<p>In spite of the Roman origin suggested by its name, so few
remains have been found here that it is doubtful whether Chesterfield
was a Roman station. Chesterfield (<i>Cestrefeld</i>) owes its
present name to the Saxons. It is mentioned in Domesday only
as a bailiwick of Newbold belonging to the king, and granted to
William Peverell. In 1204 John gave the manor to William
Bruere and granted to the town all the privileges of a free
borough which were enjoyed by Nottingham and Derby; but
before this it seems to have had prescriptive borough rights.
Later charters were granted by various sovereigns, and it was
incorporated by Elizabeth in 1598 under the style of a mayor,
6 brethren and 12 capital burgesses. This charter was confirmed
by Charles II. (1662), and the town was so governed till the
Municipal Act 1835 appointed a mayor, 3 aldermen and 12
councillors. In 1204 John granted two weekly markets, on
Tuesday and Saturday, and an annual fair of eight days at the
feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (Sept. 14). This fair,
which is still held, and another on Palm Tuesday, are mentioned
in the <i>Quo Warranto</i> roll of 1330. The Tuesday market has long
been discontinued. That Chesterfield was early a thriving centre
is shown by the charter of John Lord Wake, lord of the manor,
granting a gild merchant to the town. In 1266 the town was the
scene of a battle between the royal forces and the barons, when
Robert de Ferrers, earl of Derby, was taken prisoner. In 1586
there was a terrible visitation of the plague; and the parliamentarian
forces were overthrown here in the Civil War. With
the development of cotton and silk industries the town has
increased enormously, and is now second in importance only to
Derby among the towns of the county. There is no record
that it ever returned representatives to parliament.</p>

parliamentary division of Durham, England, near the river
Wear, 6 m. N. of the city of Durham on the North-Eastern
railway. Pop. (1901) 11,753. The parish church of St Mary
and St Cuthbert is an interesting building, formerly collegiate,
with a tower 156 ft. high, and a remarkable series of monumental
tombs of the Lumley family, collected here from Durham
cathedral and various ruined monasteries, and in some cases
remade. About 1 m. along the river is Lumley Castle, the seat
of the earl of Scarborough, and about 2 m. north lies Lambton
Castle, the residence of the earl of Durham, built in 1797 on the
site of the old House of Harraton. Collieries and iron-works
employ the industrial population. Chester-le-Street is a place of
considerable antiquity. It lies on a branch of the Roman north
road, on which it was a station, but the name is not known.
Under the name of <i>Cunecastre</i> it was made the seat of a bishop
in 882, and continued to be the head of the diocese till the
Danish invasion of 995. During that time the church was the
repository of the shrine of St Cuthbert, which was then removed

<p><span class="bold">CHESTERTON, GILBERT KEITH<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (1874-&emsp;&emsp;), English
journalist and author, who came of a family of estate-agents,
was born in London on the 29th of May 1874. He was educated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
at St Paul&rsquo;s school, which he left in 1891 with the idea of studying
art. But his natural bent was literary, and he devoted himself
mainly to cultivating that means of expression, both in prose
and verse; he did occasional reviewing, and had some experience
in a publisher&rsquo;s office. In 1900, having already produced a
volume of clever poems, <i>The Wild Knight</i>, he definitely took to
journalism as a career, and became a regular contributor of signed
articles to the Liberal journals, the <i>Speaker</i> and <i>Daily News</i>.
He established himself from the first as a writer with a distinct
personality, combative to a swashbuckling degree, unconventional
and dogmatic; and the republication of much of his
work in a series of volumes (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Twelve Types</i>, <i>Heretics</i>, <i>Orthodoxy</i>),
characterized by much acuteness of criticism, a pungent
style, and the capacity of laying down the law with unflagging
impetuosity and humour, enhanced his reputation. His powers
as a writer are best shown in his studies of Browning (in the
&ldquo;English Men of Letters&rdquo; series) and of Dickens; but these
were only rather more ambitious essays among a medley of
characteristic utterances, ranging from fiction (including <i>The
Napoleon of Notting-hill</i>) to fugitive verse, and from artistic
criticism to discussions of ethics and religion. The interest
excited by his work and views was indicated and analysed in an
anonymous volume (<i>G.K. Chesterton: a Criticism</i>) published
in 1908.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHESTNUT<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> (<i>nux Castanea</i>), the common name given to two
sorts of trees and their fruit, (1) the so-called &ldquo;horse-chestnut,&rdquo;
and (2) the sweet or &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; chestnut.</p>

<p>(1) The common horse-chestnut, <i>Aesculus Hippocastanum</i>
(Ger. <i>Rosskastanie</i>; Fr. <i>marronnier d&rsquo;Inde</i>), has been stated to
be a native of Tibet, and to have been brought thence to England
in 1550; it is now, however, thought to be indigenous in the
mountains of northern Greece, where it occurs wild at 3000 to
4000 ft. above sea-level. Matthiolus, who attributes the origin
of the name of the tree to the use of the nuts by the inhabitants
of Constantinople for the relief of short-windedness and cough
in horses, remarks that no ancient writer appears to have made
mention of the horse-chestnut. Clusius (<i>Rariorum plantarum
hist.</i> i. p. 8, 1601) describes it as a vegetable curiosity, of
which in 1588 he had left in Vienna a living specimen, but of
which he had not yet seen either the flowers or recent fruit.
The dry fruit, he says, had frequently been brought from Constantinople
into Europe.</p>

<p>The tree grows rapidly; it flourishes best in a sandy, somewhat
moist loam, and attains a height of 50 to 60 or more ft., assuming
a pyramidal outline. Its boughs are strong and spreading.
The buds, conspicuous for their size, are protected by a coat of a
glutinous substance, which is impervious to water; in spring
this melts, and the bud-scales are then cast off. The leaves are
composed of seven radiating leaflets (long-wedge-shaped); when
young they are downy and drooping. From the early date of
its leafing year by year, a horse-chestnut in the Tuileries is known
as the &ldquo;Marronnier du 20 mars.&rdquo; The flowers of the horse-chestnut,
which are white dashed with red and yellow, appear in
May, and sometimes, but quite exceptionally, again in autumn;
they form a handsome erect panicle, but comparatively few of
them afford mature fruit. The fruit is ripe in or shortly before
the first week in October, when it falls to the ground, and the
three-valved thorny capsule divides, disclosing the brown and at
first beautifully glossy seeds, the so-called nuts, having a resemblance
to sweet chestnuts, and commonly three or else two in
number. For propagation of the tree, the seeds may be sown
either when fresh, or, if preserved in sand or earth, in spring.
Drying by exposure to the air for a month has been found to
prevent their germination. Rooks are wont to remove the nuts
from the tree just before they fall, and to disperse them in various
directions. The tree is rarely planted in mixed plantations
where profit is an object; it interferes with its neighbours and
occupies too much room. It is generally introduced near
mansion-houses for ornament and shade, and the celebrated avenues
at Richmond and Bushey Park in England are objects of great
beauty at the time of flowering.</p>

<p>The bark of the horse-chestnut contains a greenish oil, resin, a
yellow body, a tannin, C<span class="su">26</span>H<span class="su">24</span>O<span class="su">12</span>, existing likewise in the seeds
and various parts of the tree, and decomposable into <i>phloroglucin</i>
and <i>aesciglyoxalic acid</i>, C<span class="su">7</span>H<span class="su">5</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, also <i>aesculetin hydrate</i>, and the
crystalline fluorescent compound <i>aesculin</i>, of the formula C<span class="su">21</span>H<span class="su">24</span>O<span class="su">13</span>
(Rochleder and Schwarz), with which occurs a similar substance
<i>fraxin</i>, the <i>paviin</i> of Sir G.G. Stokes (<i>Q.J. Chem. Soc.</i> xi. 17,
1859; xii. 126, 1860), who suggests that its presence may perhaps
account for the discrepancies in the analyses of aesculin given by
different authors. From the seeds have been obtained starch
(about 14%), gum, mucilage, a non-drying oil, phosphoric acid,
salts of calcium, <i>saponin</i>, by boiling which with dilute hydrochloric
or sulphuric acid <i>aesculic acid</i> is obtained, <i>quercitrin</i>,
present also in the fully developed leaves, <i>aescigenin</i>, C<span class="su">12</span>H<span class="su">26</span>O<span class="su">2</span>,
and <i>aesculetin</i>, C<span class="su">9</span>H<span class="su">6</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, which is procurable also, but in small
quantity only, from the bark. Friedrich Rochleder has described
as constituent principles of the cotyledons <i>aphrodaescin</i>, C<span class="su">52</span>H<span class="su">82</span>O<span class="su">23</span>,
a bitter glucoside, <i>argyraescin</i>, C<span class="su">27</span>H<span class="su">42</span>O<span class="su">12</span>,
<i>aescinic acid</i>, C<span class="su">24</span>H<span class="su">40</span>O<span class="su">12</span>, and <i>queraescitrin</i>,
C<span class="su">41</span>H<span class="su">46</span>O<span class="su">25</span>, found also in the leaves. To prepare
pure starch from the seeds, Flandin (<i>Compt. rend.</i> xxvii. 391,
1848; xxviii. 138, 1849) recommends kneading them, when
peeled and bruised, in an aqueous solution of 1/100 to 1/60 of their
weight of sodium carbonate. E. Staffel (<i>Ann. d. Chem. u.
Pharm.</i> lxxvi., 1850, p. 379) after drying found, in spring and
autumn respectively, 10.9 and 3.38% of ash in the wood, 8.68
and 6.57 in the bark, and 7.68 and 7.52 in the leaves of the
horse-chestnut. The ash of the unripe fruit contains 58.77, that of the
ripe kernel 61.74, and that of the green shell 75.91% of potash (E. Wolff).</p>

<p>The wood of the horse-chestnut is soft, and serves only for
the making of water-pipes, for turner&rsquo;s work and common
carpentry, as a source of charcoal for gunpowder, and as fuel.
Newly cut it weighs 60 &#8468;, and dry 35 &#8468; per cub. ft. approximately.
The bark has been employed for dyeing yellow and for
tanning, and was formerly in popular repute as a febrifuge and
tonic. The powder of the dried nuts was at one time prescribed
as a sternutatory (to encourage sneezing) in the Edinburgh
<i>Pharmacopoeia</i>. It is stated to form with alum-water a size or
cement highly offensive to vermin, and with two parts of wheaten
flour the material for a strong bookbinder&rsquo;s paste. Infusion of
horse-chestnuts is found to expel worms from soil, and soon to
kill them if they are left in it. The nuts furthermore have been
applied to the manufacture of an oil for burning, cosmetic
preparations and starch, and in Switzerland, France and Ireland,
when rasped on ground, to the bleaching of flax, hemp, silk and
wool. In Geneva horse-chestnuts are largely consumed by
grazing stock, a single sheep receiving 2 &#8468; crushed morning and
evening. Given to cows in moderate quantity, they have been
found to enhance both the yield and flavour of milk. Deer
readily eat them, and, after a preliminary steeping in lime-water,
pigs also. For poultry they should be used boiled, and mixed
with other nourishment. The fallen leaves are relished by sheep
and deer, and afford a good litter for flocks and herds.</p>

<p>One variety of the horse-chestnut has variegated leaves, and
another double flowers. Darwin observed that <i>Ae. Pavia</i>, the red
buckeye of North America, shows a special tendency, under
unfavourable conditions, to be double-blossomed. The seeds of
this species are used to stupefy fish. The scarlet-flowered horse-chestnut,
<i>Ae. rubicunda</i>, is a handsome tree, less in height and
having a rounder head than the common form; it is a native of
North America. Another species, possessing flowers with the
lower petals white with a red tinge, and the upper yellow and red
with a white border, and fruit unarmed, is <i>Ae. indica</i>, a native of
the western Himalayas. Among the North American species are
the foetid or Ohio buckeye, <i>Ae. glabra</i>, and <i>Ae. flava</i>, the sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
buckeye. <i>Ae. californica</i>, when full-grown and in flower, is a
beautiful tree, but its leaves often fall before midsummer.</p>

<p>(2) The Spanish or sweet chestnut, <i>Castanea sativa</i> (natural
order, Fagaceae), is a stately and magnificent tree, native of the
countries bordering on the Mediterranean, but also ripening its
fruit in sheltered situations as far north as Scotland. It lives
very long, and attains a large size, spreading its branches widely.
It has large glossy lanceolate leaves with a toothed margin. The
flowers, which appear in early summer, are in pendulous, slender
yellowish catkins, which bear a number of staminate flowers with
a few pistillate flowers at the base. The staminate contain 8 to 20
stamens which produce an enormous amount of dusty yellow
pollen, some of which gets carried by wind to the protruding
stigmas of the pistillate flowers. The latter are borne three
together, invested by a cupule of four green bracts, which, as the
fruit matures, grow to form the tough green prickly envelope
surrounding the group of generally three nuts. The largest
known chestnut tree is the famous <i>Castagno di cento cavalli</i>, or the
chestnut of a hundred horses, on the slopes of Mount Etna, a tree
which, when measured about 1780 by Count Borch, was found to
have a circumference of 190 ft. The timber bears a striking
resemblance to that of the oak, which has been mistaken for
chestnut; but it may be distinguished by the numerous fine
medullary rays. Unlike oak, the wood is more valuable while
young than old. When not more than fifty years old it forms
durable posts for fences and gates; but at that age it often begins
to deteriorate, having ring-shakes and central hollows. In a
young state, when the stems are not above 2 in. in diameter at the
ground, the chestnut is found to make durable hoops for casks and
props for vines; and of a larger size it makes good hop-poles.</p>

<p>Chestnuts (the fruit of the tree) are extensively imported into
Great Britain, and are eaten roasted or boiled, and mashed or
otherwise as a vegetable. In a raw state they have a sweet taste,
but are difficult of digestion. The trees are very abundant in the
south of Europe, and chestnuts bulk largely in the food resources
of the poor in Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In Italy
the kernels are ground into meal, and used for thickening soups,
and even for bread-making. In North America the fruits of an
allied species, <i>C. americana</i>, are eaten both raw and cooked.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHETTLE, HENRY<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1564?-1607?), English dramatist and
miscellaneous writer, was the son of Robert Chettle, a London
dyer. He was apprenticed in 1577 to a stationer, and in 1591
became a partner with William Hoskins and John Danter. In
1592 he published Robert Greene&rsquo;s <i>Groatsworth of Wit</i>. In the
preface to his <i>Kind Herts Dreame</i> (end of 1592) he found it
necessary to disavow any share in that pamphlet, and incidentally
he apologized to three persons (one of them commonly identified
with Shakespeare) who had been abused in it. <i>Piers Plainnes
Seaven Yeres Prentiship</i>, the story of a fictitious apprenticeship in
Crete and Thrace, appeared in 1595. As early as 1598 Francis
Meres includes him in his <i>Palladis Tamia</i> as one of the &ldquo;best for
comedy,&rdquo; and between that year and 1603 he wrote or
collaborated in some forty-nine pieces. He seems to have been
generally in debt, judging from numerous entries in Henslowe&rsquo;s
diary of advances for various purposes, on one occasion (17th of
January 1599) to pay his expenses in the Marshalsea prison, on
another (7th of March 1603) to get his play out of pawn. Of
the thirteen plays usually attributed to Chettle&rsquo;s sole authorship
only one was printed. This was <i>The Tragedy of Hoffmann: or a
Revenge for a Father</i> (played 1602; printed 1631), a share in
which Mr Fleay assigns to Thomas Heywood. It has been
suggested that this piece was put forward as a rival to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<i>Hamlet</i>. Among the plays in which Chettle had a share
is catalogued <i>The Danish Tragedy</i>, which was probably either
identical with <i>Hoffmann</i> or another version of the same story.
<i>The Pleasant Comedie of Patient Grissill</i> (1599), in which he
collaborated with Thomas Dekker and William Haughton, was
reprinted by the Shakespeare Society in 1841. It contains the
lyric &ldquo;Art thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers,&rdquo; which is
probably Dekker&rsquo;s. In November 1599 Chettle receives ten
shillings for mending the first part of &ldquo;Robin Hood,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> <i>The
Downfall of Robert, Earl of Huntingdon</i>, by Anthony Munday;
and in the second part, which followed soon after and was printed
in 1601, <i>The Death of Robert, Earle of Huntingdon</i>, he collaborated
with Munday. Both plays are printed in Dodsley&rsquo;s <i>Select
Collection of Old English Plays</i> (ed. W. C. Hazlitt, vol. viii.). In
1603 Chettle published <i>England&rsquo;s Mourning Garment</i>, in which are
included some verses alluding to the chief poets of the time. His
death took place before the appearance of Dekker&rsquo;s <i>Knight&rsquo;s
Conjurer</i> in 1607, for he is there mentioned as a recent arrival in
limbo.</p>

<p><i>Hoffmann</i> was edited by H. B(arrett) L(ennard) (1852) and by
Richard Ackermann (Bamberg, 1894).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEVALIER, ALBERT<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> (1861-&emsp;&emsp;), English comedian, began
a connexion with the stage while still a child. In 1877 he was
engaged as an actor under the Bancrofts in London, and for some
years played &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; parts at the Court theatre and
elsewhere. In 1891, however, he began a successful music-hall
career as a singer of coster songs of his own invention, a new type
in which he had an immediate success, both in England and
America. He subsequently organized an entertainment of his
own, with sketches and songs, with which he went on tour, establishing
a wide popularity as an original artist in his special line.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHEVALIER, MICHEL<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> (1806-1879), French economist, was
born at Limoges on the 13th of January 1806. In his early
manhood, while employed as an engineer, he became a convert to
the theories of Saint Simon; these he ardently advocated in the
<i>Globe</i>, the organ of the Saint Simonians, which he edited until his
arrest in 1832 on a charge of outraging public morality by its
publication. He was sentenced to a year&rsquo;s imprisonment, but was
released in six months through the intervention of Thiers, who
sent him on a special mission to the United States to study the
question of land and water transport. In 1836 he published, in
two volumes, the letters he wrote from America to the <i>Journal
des débats</i>. These attracted so much attention that he was sent
in the same year on an economic mission to England, which resulted
in his publication (in 1838) of <i>Des intérêts matériels de la
France</i>. The success of this made his position secure, and in 1840
he was appointed professor of political economy in the Collège de
France. He sat for a short time (1845-1846) as a member of the
Chamber of Deputies, but lost his seat owing to his enthusiastic
adoption of the principles of free trade. Under Napoleon III. he
was restored to the position of which the revolution of 1848 had
temporarily deprived him. In 1850 he became a member of the
Institute, and in the following year published an important work
in favour of free trade, under the title of <i>Examen du système
commercial connu sous le nom de système protecteur</i>. His chief
public triumph was the important part he played in bringing
about the conclusion of the commercial treaty between France
and Great Britain in 1860. Previously to this he had served, in
1855, upon the commission for organizing the Exhibition of 1855,
and his services there led to his forming one of the French jury of
awards in the London Exhibition of 1862. He was created a
member of the Senate in 1860, and continued for some years to
take an active part in its discussions. He retired from public life
in 1870, but was unceasingly industrious with his pen. He
became grand officer of the Legion of Honour in 1861, and during
the later years of his life received from many quarters public
recognition of his eminence as a political economist. He died at
his château near Montpellier (Hérault) on the 28th of November
1879. Many of his works have been translated into English and
other languages. Besides those already mentioned the more
important are: <i>Cours d&rsquo;économie politique</i> (1842-1850);
<i>Essais de politique industrielle</i> (1843);
<i>De la baisse probable d&rsquo;or</i>(1859, translated into English by Cobden,
<i>On the Probable Fall of the Value of Gold</i>, Manchester, 1859);
<i>L&rsquo;Expédition du Mexique</i> (1862);
<i>Introduction aux rapports du jury international</i> (1868).</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEVALIER, ULYSSE<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), French bibliographer,
was born at Rambouillet on the 24th of February 1841. He
published a great number of documents relating to the history of
Dauphiné, <i>e.g.</i> the cartularies of the church and the town of Die
(1868), of the abbey of St André le-Bas at Vienne (1869), of the
abbey of Notre Dame at Bonnevaux in the diocese of Vienne
(1889), of the abbey of St Chaffre at Le Monestier (1884), the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
inventories and several collections of archives of the dauphins of
Viennais, and a <i>Bibliothèque liturgique</i> in six volumes (1893-1897),
the third and fourth volumes of which constitute the <i>Repertorium
hymnologicum</i>, containing more than 20,000 articles. But his
principal work is the <i>Répertoire des sources historiques du moyen
âge</i>. The first part, <i>Bio-bibliographie</i> (1877-1886; 2nd ed., 1905),
contains the names of all the historical personages alive between
the years 1 and 1500 who are mentioned in printed books,
together with the precise indication of all the places where they
are mentioned. The second part, <i>Topo-bibliographie</i> (1894-1903),
contains not only the names of places mentioned in books
on the history of the middle ages, but, in a general way, everything
not included in the <i>Bio-bibliographie</i>. The <i>Répertoire</i> as a
whole contains an enormous mass of useful information, and is one
of the most important bibliographical monuments ever devoted to
the study of medieval history. Though a Catholic priest and
professor of history at the Catholic university of Lyons, the Abbé
(afterwards Canon) Chevalier knew how to maintain an independent
critical attitude even in religious questions. In the
controversy on the authenticity of the Holy Shroud (<i>sudario</i>) at
Turin, he worked in the true scientific spirit by tracing back the
history of that piece of stuff, which was undoubtedly used as a
shroud, but which was not produced before the 14th century and
is probably no older (See <i>Le Saint Suaire de Lirey-Chambéry-Turin
et les défenseurs de son authenticité</i>). Similarly, in <i>Notre
Dame de Lorette; étude critique sur l&rsquo;authenticité de la Santa Casa</i>
(1906), he dissipated by the aid of authentic documents the
legend which had embellished and falsified the primitive history
of that sanctuary.</p>

<i>Spanische Reiter</i>, &ldquo;Spanish horsemen&rdquo;), a military obstacle,
originating apparently in the Dutch War of Independence, and
used to close the breach of a fortress, streets, &amp;c. It was formerly
often used in field operations as a defence against cavalry; hence
the name, as the Dutch were weak in the mounted arm and had
therefore to check the enemy&rsquo;s cavalry by an artificial obstacle.

<p><span class="bold">CHEVERUS, JEAN LOUIS ANNE MAGDELEINE LEFEBVRE DE<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span>
(1768-1836), French ecclesiastic, was born on the 28th of
January 1768, in Mayenne, France, where his father was general
civil judge and lieutenant of police. He studied at the college of
Mayenne, received the tonsure when twelve, became prior of
Torbechet while still little more than a child, thence derived
sufficient income for his education, entered the College of Louis le
Grand in 1781, and after completing his theological studies at the
Seminary of St Magloire, was ordained deacon in October 1790,
and priest by special dispensation on the 18th of December. He
was immediately made canon of the cathedral of Le Mans and
began to act as vicar to his uncle in Mayenne, who died in 1792.
Owing to the progress of the Revolution he emigrated in 1792 to
England, and thence in 1796 to America, settling in Boston, Mass.
His interest had been aroused by François Antoine Matignon, a
former professor at Orleans, now in charge under Bishop John
Carroll of all the Catholic churches and missions in New England.
Cheverus, although at first appointed to an Indian mission in
Maine, remained in Boston for nearly a year, and returned thither
after several months in the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy
missions and visits to scattered Catholic families along the way.
During the epidemic of yellow fever in 1798 he won great praise
and respect for his courage and charity; and his preaching was
listened to by many Protestants&mdash;indeed the subscriptions for the
Church of the Holy Cross which he founded in 1803 were largely
from non-Catholics. In 1808 the papal brief was issued making
Boston a bishopric, suffragan to Baltimore, and Cheverus its
bishop. He was consecrated on All Saints&rsquo; day in 1810, at St
Peter&rsquo;s, Baltimore, by Archbishop Carroll. On the death of the
latter his assistant bishop, Neale, urged the appointment of
Cheverus as assistant to himself; Cheverus refused and warmly
asserted his desire to remain in Boston; but, much broken by the
death of Matignon in 1818 and with impaired health, he soon
found it necessary to leave the seat of his bishopric. In 1823,
Louis XVIII. having insisted on his return to France, Cheverus
became bishop of Montauban, where his tolerance captivated the
Protestant clergy and laymen of the city. He was made archbishop
of Bordeaux in 1826; and on the 1st of February 1836, in
accordance with the wish of Louis Philippe, he was made a
cardinal. He died in Bordeaux on the 19th of July 1836. To
Cheverus, more than to any other, is due the position that Boston
now holds in the Roman Catholic Church of America, as well as
the general growth of that church in New England. His character
was essentially lovable: the Jews of Bordeaux and Protestants
everywhere delighted to honour him.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHEVET<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span>, the term employed in French architecture to
distinguish the apsidal end of a church, in which the apses or
chapels radiate round the choir aisle. The two earliest examples
(11th and 12th century) are found in the churches of St Hilaire,
Poitiers, and Notre Dame-du-Port, Clermont, where there are
four apses. A more usual number is five, and the central apse,
being of larger dimensions, becomes the Lady chapel. This was
the case in Westminster Abbey, where Henry III. introduced the
chevet into England; Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel is built on the site of
the original Lady chapel, which must have been of exceptional
size, as it extended the whole length of the present structure. In
Solignac, Fontevrault and Paray-le-Monial there are only three,
in these cases sufficiently distant one from the other to allow of a
window between. The usual number in all the great cathedrals
of the 13th century, as in Bourges, Chartres, Reims, Troyes,
Tours, Bayeux, Antwerp and Bruges, is five. In Beauvais,
Amiens and Cologne there are seven apsidal chapels, and in
Clairvaux nine radiating but rectangular chapels. In the 14th
and 15th centuries the central apse was increased in size and
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, as in St Ouen at Rouen.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHEVIOT HILLS<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span>, a range forming about 35 m. of the border
between England and Scotland. The boundary generally
follows the line of greatest elevation, but as the slope is more
gradual southward and northward the larger part of the range is
in Northumberland, England, and the lesser in Roxburghshire,
Scotland. The axis runs from N.E. to S.W., with a northward
tendency at the eastern end, where the ridge culminates in the
Cheviot, 2676 ft. Its chief elevations from this point south-westward
fall abruptly to 2034 ft. in Windygate Hill, and then
more gradually to about 1600 ft. above the pass, followed by a
high road from Redesdale. Beyond this are Carter Fell (1815)
and Peel Fell (1964), after which two lines of lesser elevation
branch westward and southward to enclose Liddesdale. The
hills are finely grouped, of conical and high-arched forms, and
generally grass-covered. Their flanks are scored with deep
narrow glens in every direction, carrying the headwaters of the
Till, Coquet and North Tyne on the south, and tributaries of the
Tweed on the north. The range is famous for a valuable breed of
sheep, which find abundant pasture on its smooth declivities.
In earlier days it was the scene of many episodes of border
warfare, and its name is inseparably associated with the ballad of
<i>Chevy Chase</i>. The main route into Scotland from England lies
along the low coastal belt east of the Till; the Till itself provided
another, and Redesdale a third. There are numerous ruins of
castles and &ldquo;peel towers&rdquo; or forts on the English side in this
district.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The rocks entering into the geological structure of the
Cheviots belong to the Silurian, Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous
systems. The oldest strata, which are of Upper Silurian age,
form inliers that have been exposed by the denudation of the
younger palaeozoic rocks. One of these which occurs high up on
the slopes of the Cheviots is drained by the Kale Water and the
river Coquet and is covered towards the north by the Old Red
Sandstone volcanic series and on the south by Carboniferous strata.
Another area is traversed by the Jed Water and the Edgerston
Burn and is surrounded by rocks of Old Red Sandstone age. The
strata consist of greywackes, flags and shales with seams and zones
of graptolite shale which yield fossils sparingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span></p>

<p>On the upturned and denuded edges of the Silurian strata a great
pile of contemporaneous volcanic rocks of Lower Old Red Sandstone
age rests unconformably, which consists chiefly of lavas with
thin partings of tuff. A striking feature is the absence of coarse
sediments, thus indicating prolonged volcanic activity. They cover
an area of about 230 sq. m. in the eastern part of the Cheviots and
rise to a height of 2676 ft. above the sea. The lavas comprise dark
pitchstone, resembling that at Kirk Yetholm, and porphyritic and
amygdaloidal andesites and basalts. This volcanic platform is
pierced by a mass of granite about 20 sq. m. in extent, which forms
the highest peak in the Cheviot range. It has been described by
Dr Teall as an augite-biotite-granite having strong affinities with
the augite-bearing granitites of Laveline and Oberbrück in the
Vosges. Both the granite and the surrounding lavas are traversed
by dykes arid sills of intermediate and acid types represented by
mica-porphyrites and quartz-felsites.</p>

<p>On their north-west margin the Lower Old Red volcanic rocks
are covered unconformably by the upper division of that system
composed of red sandstones and conglomerates, which, when followed
westwards, rest directly on the Silurian platform. Towards the
south and east the volcanic pile is overlaid by Carboniferous strata,
thus indicating a prolonged interval of denudation.</p>

<p>On the northern slopes of the western part of the Cheviots the
representatives of the Cementstone group of the Carboniferous
system come to the surface, where they consist of shales, clays,
mudstones, sandstones with cementstones and occasional bands of
marine limestone. These are followed in normal order by the Fell
Sandstone group, comprising a succession of sandstones with intercalations
of red and green clays and impure cementstone bands.
They form the higher part of the Larriston Fells and are traceable
eastwards to Peel Fell, where there is evidence of successive land surfaces
in the form of dirt beds. They are succeeded by the Lewisburn
coal-bearing group, which represents the Scremerston coals.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEVREUL, MICHEL EUGÈNE<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> (1786-1889), French chemist,
was born, on the 31st of August 1786, at Angers, where his father
was a physician. At about the age of seventeen he went to Paris
and entered L.N. Vauquelin&rsquo;s chemical laboratory, afterwards
becoming his assistant at the natural history museum in the
Jardin des Plantes. In 1813 he was appointed professor of
chemistry at the Lycée Charlemagne, and subsequently undertook
the directorship of the Gobelins tapestry works, where he
carried out his researches on colour contrasts (<i>De la loi du
contraste simultané des couleurs</i>, 1839). In 1826 he became a
member of the Academy of Sciences, and in the same year was
elected a foreign member of the Royal Society of London, whose
Copley medal he was awarded in 1857. He succeeded his master,
Vauquelin, as professor of organic chemistry at the natural
history museum in 1830, and thirty-three years later assumed its
directorship also; this he relinquished in 1879, though he still
retained his professorship. In 1886 the completion of his
hundredth year was celebrated with public rejoicings; and after
his death, which occurred in Paris on the 9th of April 1889, he was
honoured with a public funeral. In 1901 a statue was erected to
his memory in the museum with which he was connected for so
many years. His scientific work covered a wide range, but his
name is best known for the classical researches he carried out on
animal fats, published in 1823 (<i>Recherches sur les corps gras
d&rsquo;origine animale</i>). These enabled him to elucidate the true
nature of soap; he was also able to discover the composition of
stearin and olein, and to isolate stearic and oleic acids, the names
of which were invented by him. This work led to important
improvements in the processes of candle-manufacture. Chevreul
was a determined enemy of charlatanism in every form, and a
complete sceptic as to the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; psychical research or
spiritualism which had begun in his time (see his <i>De la baguette
divinatoire, et des tables tournantes</i>, 1864).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHEVRON<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (Fr. from <i>chévre</i>, a goat), in architecture, the beams
or rafters in the roofs of a building, meeting in an angle with a
fancied resemblance to the horns of a butting goat; in heraldry
a bent bar on a shield, used also as a distinguishing badge of
rank on the sleeves of non-commissioned officers in most armies
and navies and by police and other organized bodies wearing
uniform, and as a mark of good conduct in the army and navy.
Chevron is also an architectural term for an inflected ornament,
called also &ldquo;zig-zag,&rdquo; found largely in romanesque architecture
in France, England and Sicily. It is one of the most common
decorations found in the voussoirs of the Norman arch, and
was employed also on shafts, as in the cloisters of Monreale near
Palermo, those of St Paul outside Rome, and many churches in
Germany. Its earliest appearance was in the tomb of Agamemnon
at Mycenae, where the shafts flanking the entrance doorway
have nine decorative chevron bands; in this case there is no
doubt it was derived from the metal casing of the early wood
columns.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHEVROTAIN<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span>, a name taken from the French to designate the
various representatives of the mammalian ungulate family
<i>Tragulidae</i>. These tiny animals, commonly known as mouse-deer,
are in no wise nearly related to the true deer, but constitute
by themselves a special section of artiodactyle ungulates known
as Tragulina, for the characteristics of which see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Artiodactyla</a></span>.
The typical genus <i>Tragulus</i>, which is Asiatic, contains the smallest
representatives of the family, the animals having more of
the general aspects and habits of some rodents, such as the
agoutis, than of other ruminants. The longest-known species are
<i>T. javanicus</i>, <i>T. napu</i>, <i>T. kanchil</i>, <i>T. stanleyanus</i> and <i>T. memmina</i>;
but a number of other forms, best regarded for the most part as
races, have been named. Of those mentioned, the first four are
from the Malay Peninsula or the islands of the Indo-Malay
Archipelago, the last from Ceylon and India. <i>Kanchil</i> and <i>napu</i>
(or <i>napoh</i>) are the Malay names of the species with those specific
titles. The second genus, <i>Dorcatherium</i> (or <i>Hyomoschus</i>), is
African, and distinguished chiefly by the feet being stouter and
shorter, the outer toes better developed, and the two middle
metacarpals not welded together. Its dental formula (as that of
<i>Tragulus</i>) is i.0/3, c.1/1, p.8/3, m.3/3=34. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 13, L. 6,
S. 5, Ca. 12-13. The only existing species, <i>D. aquaticum</i> (fig.), in
type is rather larger than any of the Asiatic chevrotains, which
it otherwise much resembles, but is said to frequent the banks of
streams, and have much the habits of pigs. It is of a rich brown
colour, with back and sides spotted and striped with white; and
it is evidently the survivor of an ancient form, as remains of a
species only differing in size (<i>D. crassum</i>) have been found in the
Miocene deposits of France. For long this species was supposed
to be restricted to West Africa, but it has recently been
obtained in East Central Africa, where it is represented by a
local race.</p>

American Indians of Algonquian stock. They formerly lived on
the Cheyenne river, North Dakota. Driven west by the Dakotas,
they were found by early explorers at the eastern base of the
Black Hills, South Dakota. Part of them later moved south
and allied themselves with the Arapahoes. Their whole history

<p><span class="bold">CHEYENNE<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span>, the chief city and capital of Wyoming, U.S.A.,
and county-seat of Laramie county, on Crow Creek, about 106 m.
N. of Denver. Pop. (1890) 11,690; (1900) 14,087, of whom 1691
were foreign-born; (1905) 13,656; (1910) 11,320. It is served by
the Union Pacific, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, and the
Colorado &amp; Southern railways. It is situated near the southern
boundary of the state, on the high plains near the E. foot of the
Laramie range, at an altitude of 6050 ft.; the surrounding
country is given up to mining (lignite and iron), grazing and
dry-farming. Among the principal buildings are the capitol,
modelled after the National Capitol at Washington; the United
States government building, the Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Home, the
Union Pacific depôt, the high school, the Carnegie library, St
Mary&rsquo;s cathedral (Roman Catholic), the Convent of the Holy
Child Jesus, the Masonic Temple and the Elks&rsquo; clubhouse. The
city has two parks, and is connected by a boulevard with Fort
D.A. Russell, an important United States military post, 4 m.
north of the city, established in 1867 and named in honour of
Major-General David Allen Russell (1820-1864) of the Union
army, who was killed at Opequan, Virginia. The industrial
prosperity of Cheyenne is largely due to the extensive railway
shops of the Union Pacific situated here; but the city is also an
important cattle market and has stock-yards. In 1905 the value
of the city&rsquo;s factory products ($924,697) was almost one-fourth
the total value of the factory products of the state. Cheyenne,
settled in 1867, when the Union Pacific reached here, was named
from the Cheyenne Indians. It was chosen as the site for the
capital of the territory in 1869, and was incorporated in the
same year.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHEYNE, THOMAS KELLY<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), English divine and
Biblical critic, was born in London, and educated at Merchant
Taylors&rsquo; School and Oxford. Subsequently he studied German
theological methods at Göttingen. He was ordained in 1864, and
held a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford, 1868-1882. During
the earlier part of this period he stood alone in the university as
a teacher of the main conclusions of modern Old Testament
criticism. In 1881 he was presented to the rectory of Tendring,
in Essex, and in 1884 he was made a member of the Old Testament
revision company. He resigned the living of Tendring in
1885 on his appointment to the Oriel professorship, which carried
with it a canonry at Rochester. In 1889 he delivered the
Bampton lectures at Oxford. In 1908 he resigned his professorship.
He consistently urged in his writings the necessity of a
broad and comprehensive study of the Scriptures in the light of
literary, historical and scientific considerations. His publications
include commentaries on the Prophets and Hagiographa, and
lectures and addresses on theological subjects. He was a joint
editor of the <i>Encyclopaedia Biblica</i> (London, 1899-1903), a work
embodying the more advanced conclusions of English biblical
criticism. In the introduction to his <i>Origin of the Psalter</i> (London,
1891) he gave an account of his development as a critical
scholar.</p>

orientalist, was born at Neuilly on the 15th of January 1773.
His father, Antoine de Chézy (1718-1798), was an engineer
who finally became director of the École des Fonts et Chaussées.
The son was intended for his father&rsquo;s profession; but in 1799 he
obtained a post in the oriental department of the national library.
About 1803 he began the study of Sanskrit, though he possessed
neither grammar nor dictionary, and by great labour he obtained
sufficient knowledge of the language to be able to compose in it
verses said to possess great elegance. He was the first professor of
Sanskrit appointed in the Collège de France (1815), a chevalier of
the Legion of Honour, and a member of the Académie des
Inscriptions. He died in 1832. Among his works were <i>Medjouin</i>

Central India. Area, 1118 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 156,139; estimated
revenue, £16,000. The chief, whose hereditary title is
raja, is a Rajput of the Ponwar clan, whose ancestor dispossessed
the descendant of Chhatar Sal, the founder of Bundelkhand
independence, towards the end of the 18th century. The state
was guaranteed to Kunwar Suni Singh Ponwar in 1806. In 1854
it would have lapsed to the British government for want of
direct heirs, but was conferred on Jagat Raj as a special act of
grace. The town of CHHATARPUR, which is named after Chhatar
Sal, and contains his cenotaph, is 70 m. by road S.W. of Banda.
Pop. (1901) 10,029. There are manufactures of paper and coarse
cutlery, and a high school. The state also contains the British
cantonment of Nowgong.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHHATTISGARH<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span>, a division of the Central Provinces of India,
comprising a British division (21,240 sq. m.) and two small
feudatory states, Raigarh (1486 sq. m.) and Sarangarh (540 sq.
m.). In 1905 the five Oriya states of Bamra, Rairakhol, Sonpur,
Patna and Kalahandi were transferred from the Central Provinces
to Bengal. Chhattisgarh, or &ldquo;the thirty-six forts,&rdquo; is a
low-lying plain, enclosed on every side by hills and forests,
while a rocky barrier shuts it off from the Nagpur plain on the
west. Two great rivers, the Nerbudda and Sone, take their rise at
the side of the Amarkantak hill in the north-west corner of the
division, the Nerbudda flowing nearly due west to the Bombay
coast, the Sone ultimately falling into the Ganges in Lower
Bengal. Protected on both sides by ranges of hills, the district
was, until late years, the least known portion of the most obscure
division of India, but recently it has been opened up by the
Bengal-Nagpur railway, and has developed into a great grain-producing
country. Its population is almost pure Hindu, except
in the two great tracts of hill and forest, where the aboriginal
tribes retired before the Aryan invasion. It remained comparatively
unaffected either by the Oriya immigration on the
east, or by the later influx of Mahrattas on the west. For though
the Mahrattas conquered and governed the country for a period,
they did not take possession of the land. In 1901 the population
of the two remaining feudatory states was 125,281, Raigarh
having 86,543 and Sarangarh 38,738. Much of the soil is still
covered with forest, but it includes fertile rice land.</p>

<p>The British division of Chhattisgarh comprises the three
districts of Drug (created in 1906), Raipur and Bilaspur. In 1905
the district of Sambalpur, together with the five feudatory states,
was transferred to Bengal. In 1901 the population of the
reduced area was 2,642,983.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">CHHINDWARA<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span>, a town and district of British India, in the
Nerbudda division of the Central Provinces. The site of the town
is 2200 ft. above sea-level, and is surrounded by ranges of low
hills. The European station extends for nearly 2 m. and is well
wooded. It is considered very healthy, and forms a resort for
European visitors from Nagpur and Kampti during the hot
weather.</p>

<p>The area of the <span class="sc">District of Chhindwara</span> is 4631 sq. m. It
has two natural subdivisions&mdash;the hill country above the slopes of
the Satpura mountains, called the Balaghat, and a tract of low
land to the south called the Zerghat. The high tableland of the
Balaghat lies for the most part upon the great basaltic formation
which stretches across the Satpuras as far east as Jubbulpore.
The country consists of a regular succession of hills and fertile
valleys, formed by the small ranges which cross its surface east and
west. The average height of the uplands is 2500 ft., but there
are many points of greater elevation. The appearance of the
Zerghat below the hills is generally open and undulating. The
country is intersected by several streams, of which the Kanhan is
the most considerable. Near the hills and along the streams are
strips and patches of jungle; the villages are usually surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
with picturesque groves of tamarind, mango and other shade-giving
trees. In the hill-country the climate is temperate and
healthy. In the cold season ice is frequently seen in the small
tanks at an elevation of about 2000 ft. Until May the hot wind is
little felt, while during the rains the weather is cool and agreeable.
The average annual rainfall amounts to 36 in. Pop. (1901)
407,927. There are manufactures of cotton cloth and brassware.
Coal in this neighbourhood began to be worked after the
opening of a branch of the Bengal-Nagpur railway to Chhindwara
and the coalfields to the north in 1905.</p>

<p>Chhindwara formed part of the dominions of the ancient Gond
dynasty of Chhindwara and Nagpur, whose seat was at Deogarh
until, in the 18th century, it was removed by Chand Sultan, son of
Bakht Buland (founder of the short-lived greatness of the
dynasty, and of the city of Nagpur) to Nagpur (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gondwana</a></span>

called the Italian Pindar, was of patrician descent, and was
born at Savona, a little town in the domain of the Genoese
republic, twenty-eight years after the birth of Ronsard, with
whom he has far more in common than with the great Greek
whose echo he sought to make himself. As he has told in the
pleasant fragment of autobiography prefixed to his works, in
which, like Caesar, he speaks of himself in the third person, he
was a posthumous child; he went to Rome at the age of nine
years, under the care of his uncle Giovanni. There he read with
a private tutor, suffered severely from two fevers in succession,
and was sent at last, for the sake of society, to the Jesuits&rsquo;
College, where he remained till his twentieth year, studying
philosophy, as he says, &ldquo;più per trattenimento che per apprendere,&rdquo;&mdash;rather
for occupation than for learning&rsquo;s sake. Losing
his uncle about this time, Chiabrera returned to Savona, &ldquo;again
to see his own and be seen by them.&rdquo; In a little while, however,
he returned to Rome, and entered the household of a cardinal,
where he remained for several years, frequenting the society of
Paulus Manutius and of Sperone Speroni, the dramatist and
critic of Tasso, and attending the lectures and hearing the conversation
of Mureto. His revenge of an insult offered him
obliged him to betake himself once more to Savona, where, to
amuse himself, he read poetry, and particularly Greek. The
poets of his choice were Pindar and Anacreon, and these he
studied till it grew to be his ambition to reproduce in his own
tongue their rhythms and structures, and so to enrich his country
with a new form of verse&mdash;in his own words, &ldquo;like his countryman,
Columbus, to find a new world or drown.&rdquo; His reputation
was made at once; but he seldom quitted Savona, though often
invited to do so, saving for journeys of pleasure, in which he
greatly delighted, and for occasional visits to the courts of princes
whither he was often summoned, for his verse&rsquo;s sake, and in his
capacity as a dramatist. At the ripe age of fifty he took to
himself a wife, one Lelia Pavese, by whom he had no children.
After a simple and blameless life, during which he produced
a vast quantity of verse&mdash;epic, tragic, pastoral, lyrical and
satirical&mdash;he died in 1637, at the patriarchal age of eighty-five.
An epitaph was written for him in elegant Latin by Urban VIII.;
but on his tombstone are graven two quaint Italian hexameters
of his own, in which the gazer is warned from the poet&rsquo;s own
example not to prefer Parnassus to Calvary.</p>

<p>A maker of odes in all their elaborate pomp of strophe and
antistrophe, a master of new and complex rhythms, a coiner
of ambitious words and composite epithets, an employer of
audacious transpositions and inversions, and the inventor of a
new system of poetic diction,&mdash;it is not surprising that Chiabrera
should have been compared with Ronsard. Both were destined
to suffer eclipse as great and sudden as had been their glory.
Ronsard was succeeded by Malherbe and by French literature,
properly so-called; Chiabrera was the last of the great Italians,
and after him literature languished till the second renaissance
under Manzoni. Chiabrera, however, was a man of merit, apart
from that of the mere innovator. Setting aside his epics and
dramas (one of the latter received the honours of translation at
the hands of Nicolas Chrétien, a sort of scenic du Bartas), much
of his work remains yet readable and pleasant. His grand
Pindarics are dull, it is true, but some of his <i>Canzonette</i>, like the
anacreontics of Ronsard, are exceedingly elegant and graceful.
His autobiographical sketch is also extremely interesting. The
simple old poet, with his adoration of Greek (when a thing
pleased him greatly he was wont to talk of it as &ldquo;Greek Verse&rdquo;),
his delight in journeys and sight-seeing, his dislike for literary
talk save with intimates and equals, his vanities and vengeances,
his pride in the memory of favours bestowed on him by popes
and princes, his &ldquo;<i>infinita maraviglia</i>&rdquo; over Virgil&rsquo;s versification
and metaphor, his fondness for masculine rhymes and blank
verse, his quiet Christianity, is a figure deserving perhaps of
more study than is likely to be bestowed on that &ldquo;new world&rdquo;
of art which it was his glory to fancy his own, by discovery and
by conquest.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best editions of Chiabrera are those of Rome (1718, 3 vols.
8vo); of Venice (1731, 4 vols. 8vo); of Leghorn (1781, 5 vols. 12mo);
and of Milan (1807, 3 vols. 8vo). These only contain his lyric work;
all the rest he wrote has been long forgotten.</p></div>

<p><span class="bold">CHIANA<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (anc. <i>Clanis</i>), a river of Tuscany, which rises in the
Apennines S. of Arezzo, runs through the valley of Chiusi, and
after receiving the Paglia just below Orvieto, falls into the Tiber
after a course of 60 m. In Roman times its waters ran entirely
into the Tiber. It often caused considerable floods in the valley
of Clusium (Chiusi) which were noticeable even in Rome itself,
and in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 15 it was proposed to divert part of its waters into
the Arnus, a project which was abandoned owing to the opposition
of the Florentines (Tac. <i>Ann.</i> i. 76, 79). In the middle
ages the whole of its valley from Arezzo to Chiusi was an uninhabitable
swamp; but at the end of the 18th century the
engineer Count Fossombroni took the matter in hand, and
moved the watershed some 25 m. farther south, so that its waters
now flow partly into the Arno and partly into the Tiber.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHIAPAS<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span>, a Pacific coast state of southern Mexico on the
Guatemalan frontier, bounded by the states of Tabasco on the
N. and Vera Cruz and Oaxaca on the W. Pop. (1895) 318,730;
(1900) 360,799, a large proportion of which are Indians;
area, 27,222 sq.m. largely forested. The Sierra Madre crosses
the southern part of the state parallel with the coast, separating
the low, humid, forested districts on the frontier of Tabasco
from the hot, drier, coastal plain on the Pacific. The mountain
region includes a plateau of great fertility and temperate climate,
which is one of the best parts of Mexico and contains the larger
part of the population of the state. But isolation and lack of
transportation facilities have retarded its development. The
extension of the Pan-American railway across the state, from
San Gerommo, on the Tehuantepec National line, to the Guatemalan
frontier, is calculated to improve the industrial and social
conditions of the people. The principal industries are agriculture,
which is very backward, stock-raising, timber-cutting, fruit-farming
and salt-making. Coffee-planting is a new industry
on the Pacific slope of the Sierra Madre at elevations of 2000 to
4000 ft., and has met with considerable success. Rubber
plantations have also been laid out, principally by American
companies, the <i>Castilloa elastica</i> doing well. The exports include
cattle, hides, coffee, rubber, fruit and salt. The mineral resources
include gold, silver, copper and petroleum, but no mines were in
operation in 1906. The capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez (pop. 9395
in 1900), is on the plateau, 3&frac12; m. from the Rio Sabinas, and 138
m. N.E. of the Pacific port of Tonala. The former capital,
San Cristobal (pop. about 5000 in 1895), about 40 m. E. of
Tuxtla, is an interesting old town and the seat of the bishopric
of Chiapas, founded in 1525 and made famous through its
associations with Las Casas. Tapachula (pop. in 1895, 6775),
the capital of the department of Soconusco, 18 m. from the
Guatemalan frontier, is a rising commercial town of the new
coffee district. It is 24 m. inland from the small port of San
Benito, is 559 ft. above sea-level, and has a healthy climate.
Other prominent towns with their populations in 1895, are
Comitan, or Comitlan (9316), on the Rio Grijalva about 40 m.
S.E. of San Cristobal, and chiefly distinguished for its fine
church and convent dedicated to San Domingo; Pichucalco

of the Entella, in the centre of a fertile plain surrounded by
mountains except on the S.W., where it comes down to the sea.

<p><span class="bold">CHIAVENNA<a name="ar144" id="ar144"></a></span> (anc. <i>Clavenna</i>), a town of Lombardy, Italy,
in the province of Sondrio, 17 m. by rail N. of Colico which lies
at the N. end of the lake of Como. Pop. (1901) town 3140,
commune 4732. It is well situated on the right bank of the
Mera, at the mouth of the Val Bregaglia, through which the road
to the Maloja Pass and the Engadine runs to the east. This
line was partly followed by a Roman road, which at Casaccia,
just below the last ascent to the Maloja Pass, diverged to the
N. by the Septimer Pass, joining the Julier route to Coire (anc.
<i>Curia</i>) at Stalla. The Splügen route, which was also used by
the Romans, runs N. from Chiavenna to Coire: the modern
road was constructed by the Austrians in 1819-1821. Chiavenna
is crowned by a ruined castle, once an important strategic point,
and the seat of the counts who ruled the valley from the time
of the Goths till 1194, when the district was handed over to the
bishops of Coire. In the 14th century the Visconti, having
become masters of the Valtellina, bought the &ldquo;county&rdquo; (<i>contado</i>
or <i>contea</i>) of Chiavenna from the bishop of Coire; but it was
taken by the canton of the Grisons in 1525, and the castle
dismantled. In 1797 Chiavenna became part of the Cisalpine
republic, and thenceforward followed the fortunes of Lombardy.
The church of S. Lorenzo is baroque in style, but its baptistery
contains a font of 1206 with reliefs. Chiavenna has cotton
factories and breweries, and is a depot for the wine of the district.</p>

<p><span class="bold">CHICAGO<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span>, a city, a port of entry and the county-seat of Cook
county, Illinois, U.S.A., the second city of the United States in
population, commerce and manufactures; pop. (1900) 1,698,575;
and (1910) 2,185,283. It is situated at the south-west corner
of Lake Michigan (lat. 41° 50&prime;, long. 87° 38&prime; W.), about
913 m. distant by railway from New York, 912 m. from New
Orleans, 2265 m. from Los Angeles, and 2330 m. from Seattle.
The climate is very changeable and is much affected by the
lake; changes of more than thirty degrees in temperature
within 24 hours are not at all rare, and changes of twenty are
common. The city is the greatest railway centre of the United
States, and was for several decades practically the only commercial
outlet of the great agricultural region of the northern Mississippi
Valley. Trunk lines reach E. to Montreal, Boston, New
York, Philadelphia, Baltimore (the nearest point on the Atlantic
coast, 854 m.); S. to Charleston, Savannah, Florida, Mobile,
New Orleans, Port Arthur and Galveston; W. to the Pacific
at Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver, and to
most of these by a variety of routes. In 1905 about 14% of
the world&rsquo;s railway mileage centred in Chicago.</p>

<p>With its suburbs Chicago stretches along the shore of Lake
Michigan about 40 m. (the city proper 26.5), and the city in
1910 had a total area of 191.4 sq.m.<a name="FnAnchor_1h" id="FnAnchor_1h" href="#Footnote_1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It spreads loosely and
irregularly backward from the lake over a shallow alluvial
basin, which is rimmed to the W. by a low moraine water-parting<a name="FnAnchor_2h" id="FnAnchor_2h" href="#Footnote_2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
that separates the drainage of the lake from that of the Mississippi
Valley. The city site has been built up out of the &ldquo;Lake Chicago&rdquo;
of glacial times, which exceeded in size Lake Michigan. Three
lakes&mdash;Calumet, 3122 acres; Hyde; and part of Wolf&mdash;with a
water-surface of some 4100 acres, lie within the municipal
limits. The original elevation of what is now the business
heart of the city was only about 7 ft. above the lake, but the
level was greatly raised&mdash;in some places more than 10 ft.&mdash;over
a large area, between 1855 and 1860. The West Side, especially
in the north-west near Humboldt Park, is much higher (extreme
75 ft.). A narrow inlet from the lake, the Chicago river, runs
W. from its shore about a mile, dividing then into a north and
a south branch, which run respectively to the N.W. and the S.W.,
thus cutting the city into three divisions known as the North,
the West and the South &ldquo;Sides,&rdquo; which are united by three
car-tunnels beneath the river as well as by the bridges across it.<a name="FnAnchor_3h" id="FnAnchor_3h" href="#Footnote_3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a>
The river no longer empties into Lake Michigan since the completion
of the drainage canal. Its commercial importance is
very great: indeed it is probably the most important non-tidal
stream of its length in the world, or if it be regarded as a harbour,
one of the greatest; the tonnage of its yearly commerce far
exceeds that of the Suez Canal and almost equals the tonnage
of the foreign trade (the domestic excluded) of the Thames or
the Mersey. The increase in size of the newer freighters that
ply on the Great Lakes<a name="FnAnchor_4h" id="FnAnchor_4h" href="#Footnote_4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> has proved one serious difficulty, and
the bridges and the river tunnels, which hinder the deeper
cutting of the channel, are others. The improvement of the
outer harbour by the national government was begun in 1833.
Great breakwaters protect the river mouth from the silting shore
currents of the lake and afford secure shelter in an outer roadstead
from its storms, and there is a smaller inner-basin (about
450 acres, 16 ft. depth) as well. But the river itself which has
about 15 m. of navigable channel, in part lined with docks, is
the most important part of the harbour. Its channel has been
repeatedly deepened, and in rectnt years&mdash;especially since 1896,
after its control as a navigable stream passed (1890) to the
federal government&mdash;widened and straightened by the removal
of jutting building constructions along its shores. Grain elevators
of enormous size, coal yards, lumber yards and grimy warehouses
or factories crowd close upon it. The shipping facilities on the
river are not so good in some ways, however, as on the Calumet
in southeastern (or South) Chicago, whither there has been a
strong movement of manufactures and heavy commerce.</p>

<p>The plan of the city is in general &ldquo;regular,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> rigidly rectangular,
and the streets are in general wide. The evenness
of the plain has saved Chicago from most of the vast expense,
incurred by some American cities (notably Boston and San
Francisco) in the extension or levelling of their sites and the
removal of obstructions unfavourable to their development.
The business district is concentrated in a small area of the South
Side, just below the main river and between the south branch
and the lake. A number of the railway terminals, almost all
the great wholesale and retail houses, the leading hotels and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
public buildings are crowded within an area of about 1.5 sq.m.
The congestion of the streets&mdash;considerably lessened since the
freight-subways have reduced the amount of heavy trucking&mdash;is
proportionately great, and their din and crush is characteristic
of the city. The residential districts, on the other hand, are
unevenly and loosely spread; many areas well within the city
are only sparsely settled. A belt of &ldquo;bad lands&rdquo;&mdash;occupied
by factories, shanties, &amp;c.&mdash;partially surrounds the best business
district. The smoke resulting from the use of soft coal has given
a drab and dingy colour-tone to the buildings. The low and
even relief of the site and the long vistas of the streets do not
lend themselves to the picturesque; yet this quality may be
claimed for the high and broken skyline, varied colour, massiveness,
bustle and impressive commercialism of the business
district. Chicago is generally credited with being the original
home of the steel-frame &ldquo;sky-scraper,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_5h" id="FnAnchor_5h" href="#Footnote_5h"><span class="sp">5</span></a> though there are now
higher buildings elsewhere in America. The unstable soil of
sand, clay and boulders that underlies the city is unfavourable
to tall constructions, and necessitates extraordinary attention
to foundations. The bed-rock lies, on an average, 50 ft. below
the level of the lake (in places more than a hundred). To the
rock the foundations are often sunk in caissons, the buildings
restingon monster columns of concrete and steel.<a name="FnAnchor_6h" id="FnAnchor_6h" href="#Footnote_6h"><span class="sp">6</span></a> In other cases
great &ldquo;pads&rdquo; of the same materials, resting or &ldquo;floating&rdquo; upon
the clay, sustain and distribute the weight of the building.
The small extent of the business quarter adds to the effect of its
tall structures. The Auditorium (1889; cost, $3,500,000), a huge
building containing a hotel and a theatre (5000 seats), is one of
the most massive commercial structures of the country. The
Masonic Temple (cost, $3,000,000) is the tallest in the city
(302 ft.). In 1909 there were some 475 structures ten or more
storeys high. Not a few are noteworthy, whether for size&mdash;as
the Monadnock office building of 16 storeys, with some 6000
occupants, and the new Northwestern Railway station; or for
the luxury of their interior fittings&mdash;as the La Salle, Blackstone
and Sherman hotels; or for boldness and originality in the treatment
of the steel-frame type; or for association with the city&rsquo;s life&mdash;as
the Fine Arts building, given over to varied purposes of
public amusement and artistic or intellectual improvement, or
the Railway Exchange (cased in tiles), the University Club, the
Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Trade; and many
others are handsome and dignified examples of architecture.
The Marquette building, consistently and handsomely decorated
with works of art, is one of the finest office-buildings in the
country. There are a number of enormous retail stores. The
largest, and one of the finest in the world, is that of Marshall
Field. The wholesale establishment of the same firm is the
work of H.H. Richardson, considered one of his best, and one
of the most admirable examples among American commercial
buildings. The city hall and county court house (cost, $4,500,000)
is an enormous double building in a free French Renaissance
style, with columned facades. The new Federal building
(finished in 1905; cost, $4,750,000) is a massive edifice (a low
rectangle surmounted by a higher inner cross and crowned with
a dome). The public library (1893-1897, $2,125,000), constructed
of dark granite and limestone, with rich interior decorations
of varied frescoes, mosaics, ornamental bronze and iron-work,
and mottoes, is one of the handsomest libraries of the country.
The Chicago Art Institute (1892-1893; Italian Renaissance), the
Chicago Orchestra building (1904), and the Commercial National
Bank, are also noteworthy. The finest residence streets are the
Lake Shore Drive of the North Side and the &ldquo;boulevards&rdquo;&mdash;broad
parkways that connect the parks of the city&mdash;of which
Michigan Avenue, Drexel and Grand are the finest. The city&rsquo;s
environs are not of particular beauty, but there are bluffs on
the lake to the north, and woods to the south-west, and a fair
variety of pretty hill and plain; and though the Calumet and
Chicago rivers have been given over to commerce, the valley
of the Desplaines will be preserved in the park system. On the
South Side are the Union Stockyards, established in 1865, by far
the largest in the world. They cover about 500 acres, have
about 45 m. of feeding and watering troughs, and can accommodate
at one time more than 400,000 hogs, cattle, sheep and
horses.</p>

<p><i>Public Works and Communications.</i>&mdash;Local transit is provided
for by the suburban service of the steam railways, elevated
electric roads, and a system of electric surface cars. Two great
public works demand notice: the water system and the drainage
canal. Water is pumped from Lake Michigan through several
tunnels connecting with &ldquo;cribs&rdquo; located from 2 to 5 m. from
shore. The &ldquo;cribs&rdquo; are heavy structures of timber and iron
loaded with stone and enclosing the in-take cylinders, which
join with the tunnels well below the bottom of the lake. The
first tunnel was completed in 1867. The capacity of the tunnels
was estimated in 1900 by two very competent authorities at
528 and 615 million gallons daily, respectively. The average
daily supply in 1909 was 475,000,000 gallons; there were then
16.6 m. of tunnels below the lake. The wastes of the city&mdash;street
washings, building sewage, the offal of slaughter-houses,
and wastes of distilleries and rendering houses&mdash;were originally
turned into the lake, but before 1870 it was discovered that the
range of impurity extended already a mile into the lake, half-way
to the water &ldquo;crib,&rdquo; and it became evident that the lake could
not be indefinitely contaminated. The Illinois and Michigan
Canal, for which the right of way was granted in 1821 and which
was built in 1836-1841 and 1845-1848, and opened in 1848
(cost, $6,557,681), was once thought to have solved the difficulty;
it is connected with the main (southern) branch of the Chicago
river, 5 m. from its mouth, with the Illinois river at La Salle,
the head of steamer navigation on the Illinois river, and is the
natural successor in the evolution of transportation of the old
Chicago portage, &frac12; m. in length, between the Chicago river and
the headwaters of the Kankakee; it was so deepened as to draw
water out from the lake, whose waters thus flowed toward the
Gulf of Mexico. It is about 96 m. long, 40-42 ft. wide, and
4-7 ft. deep, but proved inadequate for the disposal of sewage.
A solution of the problem was imperative by 1876, but almost
all the wastes of the city continued nevertheless to be poured into
the lake. In 1890 a sanitary district, including part of the city
and certain suburban areas to be affected, was organized, and
preparations made for building a greater canal that should do
effectively the work it was once thought the old canal could do.
The new drainage canal, one of the greatest sanitary works of
the world, constructed between 1892 and 1900 under the control
of the trustees of the Sanitary District of Chicago (cost up to
1901, $35,448,291), joins the south branch of the Chicago with the
Desplaines river, and so with the Illinois and Mississippi, and is
28.5 m. long,<a name="FnAnchor_7h" id="FnAnchor_7h" href="#Footnote_7h"><span class="sp">7</span></a> of which 15 m. were cut through rock; it is 22 ft.
deep and has a minimum width of 164 ft. The canal, or sewer,
is flushed with water from Lake Michigan, and its waters are
pure within a flow of 150 m.<a name="FnAnchor_8h" id="FnAnchor_8h" href="#Footnote_8h"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Its capacity, which was not at
first fully utilized, is 600,000 cub. ft. per minute, sufficient
entirely to renew the water of the Chicago river daily. A system
of intercepting sewers to withdraw drainage into the lake was
begun in 1898; and the construction of a canal to drain the
Calumet region was begun in 1910. The Illinois and Michigan
canal is used by small craft, and the new drainage canal also may
be used for shipping in view of the Federal government&rsquo;s improvements
of the rivers connecting it with the Mississippi for
the construction of a ship-canal for large vessels. The canal
also made possible the development (begun in 1903) of enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
hydraulic power for the use of the city. The Illinois and Michigan
Canal has been supplemented by the Illinois and Mississippi
Canal, commonly known as &ldquo;the Hennepin,&rdquo; from its starting
at the great bend of the Illinois river 1¾ m. above Hennepin,
not far below La Salle; the first appropriation for it was made
in 1890, and work was begun in 1892 and completed in October
1907. Its course from Hennepin is by the Bureau Creek valley
to the mouth of Queen river on the Rock river, thence by the
Rock river and a canal around its rapids at Milan to its mouth
at Rock Island on the Mississippi river. This barge canal is
80 ft. wide at water-line, 52 ft. wide at the bottom, and 7 ft. deep.
Its main feeder is the Rock river, dammed by a dam nearly
1500 ft. long between Sterling and Rock Falls, Illinois, where
the opening of the canal was celebrated on the 24th of October
1907.</p>

<p>Beginning with 1892 steam railways began the elevation
(or depression) of their main tracks, of which there were in 1904
some 838 m. within the city. Another great improvement was
begun in 1901 by a private telephone company. This is an
elaborate system of freight subways, more than 65 m. of which,
underlying the entire business district, had been constructed before
1909. It is the only subway system in the world that seeks to
clear the streets by the lessening of trucking, in place of devoting
itself to the transportation of passengers. Direct connexion is
made with the freight stations of all railways and the basements
of important business buildings, and coal, building materials,
ashes and garbage, railway luggage, heavy mail and other kinds
of heavy freight are expeditiously removed and delivered.
Telegraph and telephone wires are carried through the tunnel,
and can be readily repaired. The subway was opened for partial
operation in 1905.<a name="FnAnchor_9h" id="FnAnchor_9h" href="#Footnote_9h"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p><i>Parks.</i>&mdash;The park system may be said to have been begun in
1869, and in 1870 aggregated 1887 acres. Chicago then acquired
the name of &ldquo;The Garden City,&rdquo; which still clings to her. But
many other cities have later passed her (until in 1904, though
the second largest of the country, she ranked only thirty-second
in her holdings of park area per capita among American cities
of 100,000 population). In 1908 the acreage of the municipal
parks was 3179 acres, and there were 61.4 m. of boulevards.
After 1900 another period of ambitious development began.
The improvement of old and the creation of new &ldquo;internal&rdquo;
parks, <i>i.e.</i> within the cordon of those older parks and boulevards
that once girdled the city but have been surrounded in its later
growth; the creation of a huge metropolitan ring&mdash;similar to
that of Boston but vaster (35,000 acres)&mdash;of lake bluffs, hills,
meadows, forests and river valley; and a great increase of
&ldquo;neighbourhood parks&rdquo; in the poor districts, are included in
the new undertakings. The neighbourhood park, usually
located near a school, is almost all-inclusive in its provision for
all comers, from babyhood to maturity, and is open all day.
There are sand gardens and wading ponds and swings and day
nurseries, gymnasiums, athletic fields, swimming pools and
baths, reading-rooms&mdash;generally with branches of the city library&mdash;lunch
counters, civic club rooms, frequent music, assembly
halls for theatricals, lectures, concerts, or meetings, penny savings
banks, and in the winter skating ponds. These social centres
have practically all been created since about 1895. There are
also municipal baths on the lake front and elsewhere. The older
parks include several of great size and beauty. Lincoln Park
(area 552 acres), on the lake shore of the North Side, has been
much enlarged by an addition reclaimed from the lake. It has
fine monuments, conservatories, the only zoological garden in
the city, and the collections of the Academy of Sciences. A
breakwater carriage drive connects with a boulevard to Fort
Sheridan (27 m.) up the lake. Jackson Park (542 acres), on the
lake shore of the South Side, was the main site of the World&rsquo;s
Columbian Exposition of 1893, and contains the Field Columbian
Museum, occupying the art building of the exposition. It is
joined with Washington Park (371 acres) by the Midway Plaisance,
a wide boulevard, intended to be converted into a
magnificent sunken water-course connecting the lagoons of the
two parks with Lake Michigan. Along the Midway are the greystone
buildings of the University of Chicago, and of its
(Blaine) School of Education. On the West Side are three fine
parks&mdash;Douglas, Garfield (with a fine conservatory), and Humboldt,
which has a remarkable rose garden (respectively 182,
187 and 206 acres), and in the extreme South Side several others,
including Calumet (66 acres), by the lake side, and Marquette
(322 acres), Jackson Boulevard, Western Avenue Boulevard
and Marshall Boulevard join the South and the West Park
systems. Neither New York nor Boston has preserved as has
Chicago the beauty of its water front. The shore of the North
Side is quite free, and beginning a short distance above the river
is skirted for almost 30 m. by the Lake Shore Drive, Lincoln
Park and the Sheridan Drive. The shore of the South Side
is occupied by railway tracks, but they have been sunk and the
shore otherwise improved. In addition to Calumet and Jackson
parks there was another just below the river, Lake Park, which
has since been included in Grant Park, mostly reclaimed from
the water. Here are the public library and the building of the
Art Institute (opened in 1893); the park had also been proposed
as the site of a new building for the Field Museum of
Natural History. The park and boulevards along the lake in
1905 stretched 10.78 m., within the city limits, or almost half
the total frontage.<a name="FnAnchor_10h" id="FnAnchor_10h" href="#Footnote_10h"><span class="sp">10</span></a> The inner &ldquo;boulevards&rdquo; are broad parked
ways, 150 to 300 ft. wide, joining the parks; Chicago was the
first American city to adopt this system.</p>

<p><i>Art.</i>&mdash;Among the monuments erected in public places are a
Columbus by D.C. French and a bronze replica of French&rsquo;s
equestrian statue of Washington in Paris; statues of John A.
Logan and Abraham Lincoln by St Gaudens; monuments
commemorating the Haymarket riot and the Fort Dearborn
massacres; statues of General Grant, Stephen A. Douglas,
La Salle, Schiller, Humboldt, Beethoven and Linnaeus. There
is also a memorial to G.B. Armstrong (1822-1871), a citizen of
Chicago, who founded the railway mail service of the United
States. A city art commission approves all works of art before
they become the property of the city, and at the request of the
mayor acts in various ways for the city&rsquo;s aesthetic betterment.
The Architectural Club labours for the same end. A Municipal
Art League (organized in 1899) has done good work in arousing
civic pride; it has undertaken, among other things, campaigns
against bill-board advertisements,<a name="FnAnchor_11h" id="FnAnchor_11h" href="#Footnote_11h"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and against the smoke
nuisance.</p>

<p>The Art Institute of Chicago contains valuable collections
of paintings, reproductions of bronzes and sculpture, architectural
casts, and other objects of art. Connected with it is the
largest and most comprehensive art school of the county&mdash;including
newspaper illustration and a normal school for the
training of teachers of drawing in the public schools. The
institute was incorporated in 1879, though its beginnings go
back to 1866, while the school dates from 1878. The courses
in architecture are given with the co-operation of the Armour
Institute of Technology. There are also a number of notable
private art collections in the city. In 1894 the Chicago Public
School Art Society was founded to secure the placing of good
works of art in the public schools. Picture collections are also
exchanged among the neighbourhood-park homes.</p>

<p>Music in Chicago owes much to the German element of the
population. Especially noteworthy among musical organizations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
are the Apollo Musical Club (1872) and The Theodore Thomas
orchestra, which has disputed with the Boston Orchestra the
claim to artistic primacy in the United States. Its leader from its
organization in 1891 until his death in 1905 was Theodore Thomas,
who had long been identified with summer orchestral concerts
in the city. In 1904 a fund was gathered by public subscription
to erect a handsome building and endow the orchestra.</p>

<p>The Field Museum of Natural History, established (1894)
largely by Marshall Field, is mainly devoted to anthropology
and natural history. The nucleus of its great collection
was formed by various exhibits of the Columbian Exposition
which were presented to it. Its collections of American ethnology,
of exceptional richness and value, are constantly augmented by
research expeditions. In addition to an original endowment
of $1,000,000, Mr Field bequeathed to the museum $8,000,000,
Lo be utilized in part for the new building which is being erected
in Jackson Park.</p>

<p><i>Libraries.</i>&mdash;At the head of the libraries of the city stands the
public library<a name="FnAnchor_12h" id="FnAnchor_12h" href="#Footnote_12h"><span class="sp">12</span></a> (established 1872; opened 1874), supported by
taxation, which on the 1st of June 1910 had 402,848
volumes, and in the year 1910 circulated 1,805,012 volumes.
In 1889 John Crerar (1827-1889), a wealthy manufacturer of
railroad supplies, left to the city for the endowment of a
non-circulating library funds which in 1907 were estimated to
amount to $3,400,000. The library was incorporated in 1894
and was opened in 1897; in February 1908 it had 216,000 volumes
and 60,000 pamphlets. It occupies a floor in the Marshall Field
Building on Wabash Avenue. Another reference library was
established (opened in 1887) with a bequest (1868) of Walter
L. Newberry. It has a rich endowment, and in February 1908
had 191,644 volumes and 43,644 pamphlets. By a plan of
co-operation each of these three libraries devotes itself primarily
to special fields: the John Crerar is best for the natural, physical
and social sciences; the Newberry is particularly strong in
history, music, medicine, rare books and fine editions; the
public library covers the whole range of general literature.
The library of the University of Chicago contained in 1908 some
450,000 titles. Among other collections are those of the Chicago
Historical Society (1856; about 150,000 titles in 1908), the
Athenaeum (1871); the Law Institute and Library (1857),
which in 1908 had about 46,500 volumes; the Art Institute,
the Field Museum of Natural History, the Academy of Sciences
(1857) and the libraries of various schools.</p>

<p><i>Universities and Colleges.</i>&mdash;There are three universities situated
wholly or in part in the city. The leading institution is the
University of Chicago (<i>see</i> <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chicago, University of</a></span>). The
professional department of North-Western University is in Chicago,
while its academic department is in the suburb of Evanston.
North-Western University was organized in 1851 and is under
Methodist Episcopal control. Its students in 1908 (exclusive
of pupils in &ldquo;co-operating&rdquo; theological schools) numbered
3850; the best equipped departments are those of dentistry,
medicine and pharmacy. There are two Roman Catholic colleges
in Chicago: Loyola University (chartered in 1870), with a
department of law, called Lincoln College (1908), and a medical
department; and St. Stanislaus College (1870). The College of
Physicians and Surgeons is the medical department of the University
of Illinois, at Champaign-Urbana. Theological schools
independent of the universities include the McCormick Theological
Seminary (Presbyterian); the Chicago Theological Seminary
(Congregational, opened 1858, and including German,
Danish-Norwegian and Swedish Institutes); the Western Episcopal
Theological Seminary; a German Lutheran theological seminary,
and an Evangelical Lutheran theological seminary. There
are a number of independent medical schools and schools of
dentistry and veterinary surgery. The Lewis Institute (bequest
1877, opened 1896), designed to give a practical education to
boys and girls at a nominal cost, and the Armour Institute of
Technology, one of the best technical schools of the country,
provide technical education and are well endowed. The
Armour Institute was founded in 1892 by Philip D. Armour,
and was opened in 1893. It comprises the College of Engineering,
including, besides the usual departments, a department of
chemical engineering and a department of fire protection
engineering, a department of &ldquo;commercial tests,&rdquo; and the
Armour Scientific Academy (preparatory). In 1907 the Institute
had 1869 students. The Chicago Academy of Science (1857) has
a handsome building and museum collections in Lincoln Park.</p>

<p>The leading daily newspapers are the <i>Record-Herald, Evening
Post, News</i> (evening) and <i>Journal</i> (evening), all Independent;
the <i>Inter-Ocean</i> and <i>Tribune</i>, Republican; and the <i>Evening
American</i> and <i>Examiner</i>, both Democratic. There are several
journals in German, Bohemian, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian and
Danish. Many trade papers are published in the city, which is
also a centre for much of the religious publishing of the Middle
West. Chicago&rsquo;s position in the labour world has made it the
home of several socialist and anarchistic periodicals.</p>

<p><i>Industry and Commerce.</i>&mdash;Chicago&rsquo;s situation at the head of
the most south-western of the Great Lakes has given it great
importance in trade and industry. The development of its
extraordinary railway facilities was a recognition of its supreme
advantages as the easiest outlet for the products of the Middle
West, on whose wealth its prosperity is founded. The growth
of its trade has been marvellous. The last years of the 19th
century showed, however, an inevitable loss to Chicago in the
growth of Duluth, Kansas City and other rivals in strategic
situations. In particular, the struggle of the North and South
railway lines in the Mississippi Valley to divert to ports on the
Gulf of Mexico grain and other freight caused great losses to
Chicago. An enormous increase in the cereal trade of Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Newport News and Norfolk was partly
due to the traffic eastward over lines S. of Chicago. The traffic
of the routes through Duluth and Canada does not, indeed,
represent in the main actual losses, for the traffic is largely a
new growth; but there has been nevertheless a considerable
drain to these routes from American territory once tributary
to Chicago. Altogether the competition of the Gulf roads and the
lines running S.W. from Duluth had largely excluded Chicago
by 1899 (according to her Board of Trade) from the grain trade
W. of the Missouri river, and in conjunction with southerly E.
and W. routes had made serious inroads upon trade E. of that
river. Its facilities for receiving and distributing remain
nevertheless unequalled, and it still practically monopolizes the
traffic between the northern Atlantic seaboard and the West.
New York alone, among American cities, has a greater trade.
Chicago is the greatest railway centre, the greatest grain market,
the greatest live-stock market and meat-packing centre, and
the greatest lumber market of the world. The clearings of her
&lsquo;associated banks amounted to $13,781,843,612 in the year 1909.
The wholesale trade was estimated in 1875 at $293,900,000 and
in 1905 at $1,781,000,000. The average annual grain receipts
(including flour in wheat equivalent) in the five years 1900-1904
amounted to 265,500,000 bu. (12,902,310 in 1854; 72,369,194
in 1875), and the shipments to 209,862,966 bu. The first shipment
of wheat was of 78 bu. in 1838. The grain elevators are among
the sights of Chicago. They are enormous storehouses into
which the grain is elevated from ships and cars, sorted into
grades and reloaded for shipment; all the work is done by
machinery. Their capacity in 1904 was 65,140,000 bu.<a name="FnAnchor_13h" id="FnAnchor_13h" href="#Footnote_13h"><span class="sp">13</span></a> In
the same quinquennial period, 1900-1904, the average yearly
receipts of lumber aggregated 1,807,066,000 ft.,<a name="FnAnchor_14h" id="FnAnchor_14h" href="#Footnote_14h"><span class="sp">14</span></a> and of shingles,
410,711 thousand; of cattle, 3,078,734; of hogs, 8,334,904; of
sheep, 3,338,291; of butter, 239,696,921 &#8468;; the exports of
hides, 167,442,077 &#8468;; of dressed beef, 1,126,995,490 &#8468;; of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
lard, 410,688,319 &#8468;; of pork, 191,371 bbl.; of other hog
products, 600,503,394 &#8468;. The combined tonnage in and out
averaged 14,135,406 tons.<a name="FnAnchor_15h" id="FnAnchor_15h" href="#Footnote_15h"><span class="sp">15</span></a> There is a large direct trade with
Europe, mainly in goods that come in bond by rail from Atlantic
ports. In 1907 the value of Chicago&rsquo;s imports was $27,058,662,
and of its exports, $5,643,302.</p>

<p>The value of manufactures (from establishments under the
&ldquo;factory system&rdquo;) in 1900 was $797,879,141, 71.2% of all
those of Illinois, and in 1905 was $955,036,277, 67.7% of all
those of the state; in both these years Chicago was second only
to New York City. Wholesale slaughtering and meat-packing
(not including many by-products), valued at $256,527,949
(32.2% of the city&rsquo;s total) in 1900 and at $269,581,486 (28.2%
of the total) in 1905, are the most important of the city&rsquo;s
industries; in 1905 the product value in Chicago was 29.5%
of that for the slaughtering and meat-packing of the entire
United States. Other important manufactures are foundry and
machine shop products, $44,561,071 in 1900, and $51,774,695
in 1905; and other iron and steel products, $35,058,700 in 1900
and $27,074,307 in 1905; clothing ($58,093,572 in 1900, and
$64,913,481 in 1905); cars and other railway construction,
$28,369,956 in 1900 and $36,080,210 in 1905; malt liquors
($14,956,865 in 1900, and $16,983,421 in 1905), and furniture
($12,344,510 in 1900 and $17,488,257 in 1905). The Illinois
Steel Company has the largest rolling mills in the world. The
McCormick Harvesting Machine Company is the largest concern
in the world manufacturing agricultural implements. Pullman
in southern Chicago, in the sparsely settled outskirts of the city,
is a model little &ldquo;labour town,&rdquo; planned and constructed with
regard for both appearances and conveniences by the Pullman
Palace Car Company, which has its works here. The town
consists mainly of workmen&rsquo;s cottages. Most of the population
are dependent upon the car works. The Pullman Company
owns and operates dining and sleeping cars on practically all the
railways of the country. In addition to its own cars it builds
ordinary passenger and freight cars on contract.</p>

<p>Meat-packing is the greatest local industry and is that for
which Chicago is best known. In the enormous stock-yards
from two-thirds to four-fifths of the cattle and hogs received are
killed, and sent out in various forms of prepared meats and by-products
(lard, fertilizers, glue, butterine, soap, candles, &amp;c).<a name="FnAnchor_16h" id="FnAnchor_16h" href="#Footnote_16h"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
This industry is remarkable for the extraordinary division of
labour in its processes. In the preparation of a bullock more than
thirty specialties are involved, and some twenty different rates of
pay. This system enabled the packing companies, until checked
by the development of labour unions, to save money not only by
paying low wages for crude labour and high for skilled, but to
develop wonderful expertness in every line, and so &ldquo;speed up&rdquo;
the workmen to a remarkable pace.<a name="FnAnchor_17h" id="FnAnchor_17h" href="#Footnote_17h"><span class="sp">17</span></a> No more interesting field
can be found for the study of the qualities of foreign races. The
introduction of the refrigerator railway car in the &rsquo;seventies
of the 19th century, making possible the distant marketing of
dressed meats, enormously increased the business. The workmen
of the yards were organized in a national union of meat packers in
1897, and all the different classes of workmen have their separate
organizations, formed mainly between 1900 and 1902. The
number of women employed more than doubled in the decade
1891-1900, constituting probably about 9% of the total in the
latter year.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;Chicago is governed under a general city-charter
law of Illinois of 1870, accepted by the city in 1875. In
November 1904 the people of Illinois adopted a constitutional
amendment authorizing the legislature of the state to provide a
complete new system of local government for Chicago, but the old
system continued and is here described, the new charter, from
which so much had been hoped, being rejected by the voters of
the city by an overwhelming majority in September 1907. A
common council chosen by wards and renewed in half each year
controls the budget, police, liquor licences, city contracts and the
granting of franchises; it also confirms appointments made by
the mayor and by a vote of two-thirds may pass legislation over
his veto. The mayor, chosen for four years, is the executive
head of the city, and has large power of appointment and removal,
limited by a civil service law, under which he must submit
reasons for removals, while two-thirds of the council may prevent
them. On the other hand the mayor can veto separate items in
the council&rsquo;s budget. The administrative departments are
generally headed by single commissioners; but those of elections,
education and the public library are exceptions. The council
was once all important, but as early as the charter of 1851 it began
to lose power to the mayor, whose directive and executive powers
have steadily increased, beginning first in the financial
department. Administration was once performed entirely by boards
as in other American cities: every specific problem or demand for
municipal activity was met by an appeal to the state legislature
for special legislation and the creation of a board. The substitution
of single commissioners began in 1876. The state constitution
of 1870 forbade special legislation, prescribed a general city
charter law and forbade special amendatory acts for Chicago.
This stopped grave abuses, but because a large part of the state
has not been interested in Chicago&rsquo;s special needs and demands
for betterment it also saddled upon the city an organization
which in 1901 remained practically the same as in 1870, when
Chicago was an overgrown town of 300,000 inhabitants. Chicago
was the only large city of the state, and a charter generalized
from village experience was unsuitable for it. The parts of Cook
county outside the city have also been very jealous of forwarding
its reorganization, important features of which must be either,
the complete absorption of the county or at least the reconstitution
of the county government,<a name="FnAnchor_18h" id="FnAnchor_18h" href="#Footnote_18h"><span class="sp">18</span></a> which the constitution left
unchanged, and which, with the city&rsquo;s growth, has caused clash
of interests and authority. Nor is this dual government&mdash;though
the city has above nine-tenths of the population and pays ninetenths
of the taxes of the county&mdash;the only anomaly. Illinois
has had since 1848 a modified New England &ldquo;township&rdquo; local-government
system, and various townships have been absorbed
by Chicago, yet they all retained till after 1900 their political
structure and some of their functions. There are three park
commissions, two appointed by the governor and one by circuit court
judges, created for different parts of the old city, differently
constituted and all independent of the city; their jurisdiction
was not enlarged as the city grew, so large portions remained free
of charges for parks and boulevards. A special park commission
now supplements them and lessens this anomaly though increasing
administrative diversity. A sanitary and drainage district, not
larger than the city area but quite different from it, was created
in 1886 (present form 1890) to carry through the drainage canal.
The school board has been nominally separate from and almost
independent of the city government in power since 1857. The
courts of law are courts of the state of Illinois, but a certain
number of justices of the peace are designated by the mayor to
act as police magistrates. The initiative and referendum in local
matters has been made possible under a state law, and has
been several times exercised in important questions. Financial
arrangements have been loose and inefficient. Independent
taxing power has been lavishly granted. State, county, city,
three park boards, the school board, the public library board, the
drainage board, and as late as 1903 ten townships,<a name="FnAnchor_19h" id="FnAnchor_19h" href="#Footnote_19h"><span class="sp">19</span></a> exercised
this sovereign right within the municipal area. Tax assessment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
valuations have been excessively irregular (<i>e.g.</i> the &ldquo;equalized&rdquo;
value for 1875 was $55,000,000 greater than that for 1892), and
apparently very low. The average assessment valuation for the
years from 1904 to 1908 was $438,729,897 (403.28 millions in 1904,
and 477.19 millions in 1908), and in 1907 the highest taxing rate
was 8%. The bonded debt in 1908 was $25,157,400, about half
of it old ($11,362,726 in 1870; 4.5 millions contracted to aid
the World&rsquo;s Fair of 1893). In the early years following 1900 the
city paid more than half of its income on police; this expenditure,
per capita of population, was not high (in 1901 Boston $5.03,
New York $3.21, Chicago $2.19), and the results were not
exactly efficient. The difficulty is that the city is poor and can
pay only for strict necessities. Its poverty is due mainly to state
laws. The taxation limit on property is 1% on the cash value,
thus compelling special dependence upon all sorts of indirect
taxes; the debt limit is 5% on the assessed valuation. Since
1900 relief has been given by state law in some matters, such as
for the park system. The water system has been operated by the
city since 1851, and has been financially very successful from the
beginning: rates are far lower than in the other great cities of the
country, and a handsome net revenue accrues to the treasury.<a name="FnAnchor_20h" id="FnAnchor_20h" href="#Footnote_20h"><span class="sp">20</span></a>
A municipal electric-lighting plant (1887), which was paid for
gradually out of the general tax levy and was not built by the
sale of bonds, gave excellent results in the city service. The city,
like the state, has power to regulate the price of gas sold by
private companies. The elevation of the railway tracks within
the city was begun in 1892; at the close of 1908 the railway
companies had accepted ordinances of the City Council for the
elevation of 192.77 m. of main tracks and 947.91 m. of all tracks,
and the construction of 724 subways, at an estimated cost of
$65,000,000; at that time the railway companies had completed
the elevation of 133.83 m. of main tracks and 776 m. of all
tracks, and had constructed 567 subways, at a total expense of
$52,500,000. The system of intercepting sewers begun in 1898 to
complete the service of the drainage canal has been constructed
with the profits of the water system.</p>

<p>In addition to the movement for a new charter to remove the
anomalies and ease the difficulties already referred to, two great
problems have been in the forefront in recent years: the lessening
of municipal corruption and the control of local transit agencies.</p>

<p>The traction question may be said to have begun in 1865,
in which year, and again in 1883, public opinion was bitterly
aroused against an attempt of the traction companies to secure
a ninety-nine year extension of franchises. Following 1883 all
lines were consolidated and enormously over-capitalized (in
1905 about $150,000,000 of stocks and bonds on a 6% basis,
two-thirds of which rested only on the franchise). In 1895-1897
bold attempts to secure a 50-year extension of franchises were
defeated by Governor John P. Altgeld (1847-1902), by the
formation of a Municipal Voters&rsquo; League, and by a representative
committee of 100 sent from Chicago to attend the legislature
at Springfield. The transit service of the city had for years been
antiquated and inadequate. At the mayor&rsquo;s elections in 1897,
1899, 1901 and 1903 the victory lay with the opponents of the
companies, and in 1905 the successful party stood for immediate
municipal acquisition of all roads. Meanwhile, under the state
referendum act, the city in 1902 voted overwhelmingly for
municipal ownership and operation (142,826 to 27,990); the
legislature in 1903 by the Mueller law gave the city the requisite
powers; the people accepted the law, again declared for municipal
ownership, and for temporary compulsion of adequate
service, and against granting any franchise to any company,
by four additional votes similarly conclusive. At last, after
tedious negotiations, a definite agreement was reached in 1906
assuring an early acquisition of all roads by the city. The
issue of bonds for municipal railways was, however, declared
unconstitutional that year; and at the municipal elections of
1907 there was a complete reversal of policy; a large majority
voted this time against municipal ownership in favour of
leaving the working of the street railways in private hands,
and strengthening the powers of municipal control.</p>

<p>The active campaign for the improvement of municipal service
and politics may be said to have begun in 1896. A civil service
system was inaugurated in 1895. The salaries of the councilmen
were raised with good effect. Numerous reform associations
were started to rouse public opinion, such as the Citizens&rsquo; Association
of Chicago, organized in 1874, the Civic Federation (1894),
the Municipal Voters&rsquo; League (1896), the Legislative Voters&rsquo;
League (1901), the Municipal Lecture Association (1902), the
Referendum League of Illinois (1901), the Civil Service Reform
Association of Chicago, the Civil Service Reform Association of
Illinois (1902), the Merchants&rsquo; Club, the City Club (1903), the
Law and Order League (1904), Society of Social Hygiene (1906),
and many of the women&rsquo;s clubs took an active part. They stood
for the <i>real</i> enforcement of the laws, sanitation, pure food, public
health, the improvement of the schools and the widening of their
social influence, and (here especially the women&rsquo;s clubs) aesthetic,
social and moral progress. The Merchants&rsquo; Club reformed the
city&rsquo;s book-keeping, and secured the establishment (1899)
of the first state pawnbrokers&rsquo; society. The Civic Federation
demonstrated (1896) that it could clean the central streets for
slightly over half what the city was paying (the city has since
saved the difference); it originated the movement for vacation
schools and other educational advances, and started the Committee
of One Hundred (1897), from which sprang various other
reform clubs. The Municipal Voters&rsquo; League investigated and
published the records of candidates for the city council, and
recommended their election or defeat as the case may be.
Moreover, a &ldquo;Municipal Museum&rdquo; was organized in 1905, mainly
supported by private aid, but in part by the board of education,
in order to collect and make educational use of materials illustrating
municipal administration and conditions, physical and social.</p>

<p><i>Education and Charity.</i>&mdash;The school board is appointed by
the mayor. Since 1904 a merit system has been applied in the
advancement of teachers; civil service rules cover the rest of
the employees. Kindergartens were maintained without legal
sanction in connexion with the public schools for several years,
and for more than twenty-five years as private schools, before
their legal establishment as a part of the system in 1899. Free
evening schools, very practical in their courses, are utilized
mainly by foreigners. Vacation schools were begun in 1896.
So far as possible the school buildings are kept open for school,
lectures and entertainments, serving thus as wholesome social
centres; and a more adequate use is made of the large investment
(in 1908 about $44,500,000) which they represent. In all
the public schools manual training, household arts and economy,
and commercial studies are a regular part of the curriculum.
A department of scientific pedagogy and child study (1900)
seeks to secure a development of the school system in harmony
with the results of scientific study of children (the combination
of hand and brain training, the use of audito-visual methods,
an elastic curriculum during the adolescent period, &amp;c.). The
expenditure for all purposes by the city in 1903 for every dollar
expended for schools was only $1.713; a ratio paralleled in only
a few cities of the country.</p>

<p>Hospitals, infirmaries, dispensaries, asylums, shelters and
homes for the defective, destitute, orphaned, aged, erring,
friendless and incurably diseased; various relief societies,
and associations that sift the good from the bad among the
mendicant, the economically inefficient, and the viciously
pauper, represent the charity work of the city. Among public
institutions are the Cook County hospital (situated in the
&ldquo;Medical District&rdquo; of the West Side, where various hospitals
and schools are gathered near together), asylum and poor house.
Since 1883 a Lincoln Park Sanitarium has been maintained for
infants and small children during warm weather. Two legal-aid
societies, the Chicago Bureau of Justice (1888) and the Protective
Agency for Women and Children, collect small wage claims and
otherwise aid the poor or helpless. The most important charitable
societies of the city are the United Charities of Chicago
(1909), the United Hebrew Charities (1857), and the Associated
Jewish Charities (1900). The first is the union of the Relief
and Aid Society (1857) and the Bureau of Charities (1894),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
and tries to prevent overlapping of efforts and to weed out fraud.
Following the gradual development of New York state laws on
behalf of children was enacted the Illinois Juvenile Court Law,
which came into force on the 1st of July 1899 and was largely
the result of Chicago&rsquo;s interest in juvenile reform. Much
philanthropic work centres in the West Side with its heterogeneous
population. A famous institution is Hull House, a social
settlement of women, which aims to be a social, charitable, and
educational neighbourhood centre. It was established in 1889
by Miss Jane Addams, who became the head-worker, and Miss
Ellen Gates Starr. It includes an art building, a free kindergarten,
a fine gymnasium, a crèche, and a diet kitchen; and
supports classes, lectures and concerts. It has had a very great
influence throughout the United States. The Armour mission
(1886) for the poor is organized with similar breadth of scope.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;Of the total population in 1900 not less than
34.6% were foreign-born; the number of persons either born
abroad, or born in the United States of foreign parentage (i.e.
father or both parents foreign), was 77.4% of the population,
and in the total number of males of voting age the foreign-born
predominated (53.4%). Of the latter category 68.2% were
already citizens by naturalization. 3.9% of the inhabitants
of ten years of age or upward were illiterate (unable to write),
while the percentage of foreign-born whites was 8.2% (93.9%
of illiterate males of voting age). Germans, Irish, Poles, Swedes
and Bohemians made up respectively 29.1, 12.6, 8.6, 8.3 and
6.2% of the foreign-born population. It was estimated in 1903
by a very competent authority that above 500,000 persons
spoke German, 125,000 Polish, 100,000 Swedish, 90,000 Bohemian,
50,000 Norwegian, 50,000 Yiddish, 35,000 Dutch, 25,000 Italian,
20,000 Danish, 17,000 French and 12,000 Irish (Celtic), and
that each of fourteen foreign languages was spoken by more than
10,000 people: &ldquo;Newspapers appear regularly in 10 languages, and
church-services may be heard in about 20 languages. Chicago
is the second largest Bohemian city of the world, the third
Swedish, the fourth Norwegian, the fifth Polish, the fifth German
(New York being the fourth). In all there are some 40 languages
spoken by ... over one million&rdquo; persons.<a name="FnAnchor_21h" id="FnAnchor_21h" href="#Footnote_21h"><span class="sp">21</span></a> The death-rate
of Chicago is the lowest of the great cities of the country.
Births are but slightly in excess of deaths, so that the growth
of the city is almost wholly from immigration. The death-rate
is the lowest of the great cities of the country (16.2 in 1900;
New York, 20.4; Boston, 20.1, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>The growth of Chicago has been remarkable even for American
cities. Any resident of four-score years living in 1900 had seen
it grow from a settlement of fourteen houses, a frontier military
post among the Indians, to a great metropolis, fifth in size among
the cities of the world. In 1828 what is now the business centre
was fenced in as a pasture; in 1831 the Chicago mail was
deposited in a dry-goods box; the tax-levy of 1834 was $48.90,
and a well that constituted the city water-works was sunk at
a cost of $95.50; in 1843 hogs were barred from the town
streets. Such facts impress upon one, as nothing else can, the
marvellously rapid growth of the city. In 1830 with a population
of less than 100, in 1840 with 4479, the increase by percentages in
succeeding decades was as follows: 507.3, 264.6, 173.6, 68.3,
118.6 and 54.4; an increase equivalent to 8.6% annually,
compounded. Such a continuous &ldquo;boom&rdquo; no other American
city has ever known.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The river Chicago (an Indian name of uncertain
meaning, but possibly from Ojibwa <i>she-kag-ong</i>, &ldquo;wild onion
place&rdquo;) was visited by Joliet and Marquette in 1673, and later
by La Salle and others. It became a portage route of some
importance, used by the French in passing to the lower Illinois
country. In 1804 the United States established here Fort
Dearborn. In 1812, during the Indian War of Tecumseh, the
garrison and settlers, who had abandoned the fort and were
retreating toward safety, were attacked and overpowered by the
savages at a point now well within the city. The fort was
re-established and fitfully occupied until its final abandonment
in 1837. When Cook county was organized in 1831, Chicago,
then a tiny village, became the seat of justice. It became a
town in 1833 and a city in 1837. By that time Chicago was
confident of its future. The federal government had begun the
improvement of the harbour, and the state had started the
Illinois and Michigan canal. There was a federal land-office also,
and the land speculator and town promoter had opened a chapter
of history more picturesque, albeit sordid, than in any of the
old French days. The giant growth of the lake trade had drawn
attention before railway connexion was secure with the East in
1852, making progress even more rapid thereafter. During the
Civil War a large prison-camp for Confederate prisoners, Camp
Douglas, was maintained at Chicago. In 1870 the city had
306,605 inhabitants and was already a commercial centre of
immense importance.</p>

<p>In 1871 it suffered a terrible calamity. On the 8th of October
a fire broke out near the lumber district on the West Side.
Two-thirds of the city&rsquo;s buildings were wood, and the summer
had been excessively dry, while to make conditions worse a
high and veering wind fanned the flames. The conflagration
leaped the river to the South and finally to the North Side,
burned over an area of 3<span class="sp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="su">3</span> sq. m., destroyed 17,450 buildings
and property valued at $196,000,000,<a name="FnAnchor_22h" id="FnAnchor_22h" href="#Footnote_22h"><span class="sp">22</span></a> and rendered almost
100,000 people homeless; 250 lost their lives. The flames
actually travelled 2&frac14; m. in an air-line within 6½ hours.
Thousands of persons, fleeing before the flames and fire-brands,
sought refuge on the shore and even in the waters of the lake.
Robbery, pillage, extortion, orgies and crime added to the
general horror. In the South Side the fire was checked on the
9th by the use of gunpowder; in the North (where the water-works
were early destroyed) it had extended almost to the
prairie when rainfall finally ended its ravages, after about
twenty-seven hours of destruction. With the exception of the San
Francisco fire of 1906 this was the greatest fire of modern times.
A vast system of relief was organized and received generous aid
from all parts of the world. The money contributions from the
United States and abroad were $4,996,782; of this foreign
countries contributed nearly $1,000,000 (England half of this).
These funds, which were over and above gifts of food, clothing
and supplies, were made to last till the close of 1876. Out of
them temporary homes were provided for nearly 40,000 people;
barracks and better houses were erected, workmen were supplied
with tools, and women with sewing-machines; the sick were
cared for and the dead buried; and the poorer classes of Chicago
were probably never so comfortable as during the first two or
three years after the fire. The rebuilding of the city was
accomplished with wonderful rapidity. Work was begun before the
cinders were cold. The business district was largely rebuilt
within a year, and within three there were hardly scars of the
calamity. Wood was barred from a large area (and subsequently
from the entire city), and a new Chicago of brick and stone,
larger, finer and wealthier, had taken the place of the old.
Business and population showed no set-back in their progress.
The solidity and permanence of this prosperity were confirmed
during the financial panic of 1873, when Chicago banks alone,
among those of the large cities of the country, continued steadily
to pay out current funds.</p>

<p>In its later history certain special factors stand out, apart
from continued commercial progress.</p>

<p>Chicago has been a storm centre of labour troubles, some of
them of a specially spectacular character. There were great
strikes in the packing industry in 1886, 1894 and 1904. But
more noteworthy are the railway strike of 1894 and the unsuccessful
teamsters&rsquo; strike of 1905. The former began in the works
of the Pullman Car Company, and its leader was Eugene Victor
Debs (b. 1855). When the contentions of the Pullman employees
were taken up by the American Railway Union the strike
immediately extended to tremendous proportions. Union men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
throughout the country refused to handle Pullman cars, and
since Pullman cars are almost invariably attached to mail
trains the transportation of the United States mail was thus
obstructed. Chicago, as the greatest railway centre of the country
and the home of the strike, was naturally the seat of the most
serious complications. There was much rioting and destruction
of property, and the railway service was completely disorganized.
President Cleveland, on the ground of preventing obstruction of
the mail service, and of protecting other federal interests,
ordered a small number of federal troops to Chicago. Those
interests were, he contended, menaced by &ldquo;domestic violence&rdquo;
evidently beyond the control of the state power. Governor
Altgeld denied the inability of the state to deal with the difficulty,
and entered a strong protest against Federal interference;
but he himself did nothing to put down the disorder. Federal
troops entered the state, and almost immediately the strike
collapsed. The high officials of the Railway Union, for ignoring
a court injunction restraining them from interfering with the
movement of the mails, were imprisoned for long terms for
contempt of court.</p>

<p>Out of a strike in the McCormick works in 1886 there sprang
another famous incident in Chicago&rsquo;s history. The &ldquo;international&rdquo;
anarchists of Chicago had been organized in &ldquo;groups&rdquo;
about two years earlier, and were very active. They were advocating
a &ldquo;general strike&rdquo; for an eight-hour day, and the tense
excitement among the labourers of the city, owing to the
McCormick strike, induced unusually ultra utterances. There
was a riot at the McCormick works on the 3rd of May, in which
several men were killed by the police. An anarchist meeting
was called for the next day at the Haymarket, a square in
Randolph Street, and when the authorities judged that the
speeches were too revolutionary to be allowed to continue, the
police undertook to disperse the meeting. A bomb was thrown,
and many policemen were injured, seven fatally. No person
could be proved to have thrown the bomb, or to have been directly
implicated in its throwing; but on the ground that they were
morally conspirators and accomplices in the killing, because they
had repeatedly and publicly advocated such acts against the
servants of government, seven anarchists were condemned to
death. An application to the United States Supreme Court
for a writ of error was unanimously refused.<a name="FnAnchor_23h" id="FnAnchor_23h" href="#Footnote_23h"><span class="sp">23</span></a></p>

<p>The four-hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America
was commemorated by a World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition held
at Chicago. The site was in Jackson Park and the adjoining
Midway, and included 686 acres, of which 188 were covered by
buildings. On the 21st of October 1892&mdash;corresponding to the
12th of October 1492, O.S.&mdash;the grounds were formally dedicated,
and on the following 1st of May opened to the public, continuing
open for six months. The number of paid admissions was
21,500,000; of total admissions 27,539,521. The buildings,
planned by a commission of architects&mdash;among whom John W.
Root and Daniel H. Burnbam of Chicago were responsible for
the general scheme&mdash;formed a collection of remarkable beauty,
to which the grounds, planned by F.L. Olmsted, intersected
by lagoons and bordered by the lake, lent an appropriate setting.
The entire cost of the fair is variously estimated at from 33 to
43 million dollars, according to the inclusiveness of the estimate;
the local cost may be put at $28,151,169. Of this Chicago gave
about 10½ millions, in addition to a preparatory house-cleaning
that cost 3½ millions; and finally a very small dividend was
paid to stockholders. The whole undertaking, carried through
with remarkable enterprise, was an artistic and educational
triumph of the first order.</p>

<p>Owing to its position Chicago has long been a favourite convention
city. Lincoln (1860), Grant (1868), Garfield (1880),
Cleveland (1884 and 1892), Harrison (1888), Roosevelt (1904),
and Taft (1908) were all nominated here for president; and in
addition not a few candidates who were unsuccessful. A national
peace jubilee was held here in 1898.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
